While medicine and medical education\\nhave evolved, readers will appreciate how this classic textbook has\\nretained enduring features that have distinguished it among medical\\ntexts—a sharp focus on the clinical presentation of disease, expert\\nin-depth summaries of pathophysiology and treatment, and\\nhighlights of emerging frontiers of science and medicine. Indeed,\\nHarrison’s retains its conviction that, in the profession of medicine,\\nwe are all perpetual students with lifelong learning as our common\\ngoal.\\nHarrison’s is intended for learners throughout their careers. For\\nstudents, Part 1, Chapter 1 begins with an overview of “The Practice\\nof Medicine.” In this introductory chapter, the editors continue the\\ntradition of orienting clinicians to the science and the art of medicine,\\nemphasizing the values of our profession while incorporating new\\nadvances in technology, science, and clinical care. Part 2, “Cardinal\\nManifestations and Presentation of Diseases,” is a signature feature\\nof Harrison’s. These chapters eloquently describe how patients\\npresent with common clinical conditions, such as headache, fever,\\ncough, palpitations, or anemia, and provide an overview of typical\\nsymptoms, physical findings, and differential diagnosis. Mastery of\\nthese topics prepares students for subsequent chapters on specific\\ndiseases they will encounter in courses on pathophysiology and in\\nclinical clerkships. For residents and fellows caring for patients and\\npreparing for board examinations, Harrison’s remains a definitive\\nsource of trusted content written by internationally renowned experts.\\nTrainees will be reassured by the depth of content, comprehensive\\ntables, and illuminating figures and clinical algorithms.

A simple rule of thumb for patients is: “If you are\\ndoing nothing, do something; and if you are doing something, do\\nmore, every day.” The evidence base for physical activity indicates\\nthat the marginal benefits from physical activity are greatest in\\nadvancing from no activity to low levels of moderate activity. With\\nincreasing duration and intensity of activity, there is a continued\\ncurvilinear increase in health benefits, but the marginal gains for\\neach additional minute of moderate-to-vigorous activity slowly\\ndiminish. Thus, for adults, the recommended amount of physical\\nactivity is 150 min of moderate-intensity or 75 min of vigorous-\\nintensity aerobic activity per week, performed in episodes of at least\\n5 min, and preferably spread throughout the week, plus participation\\nin muscle-strengthening activity at least 2 days per week.

Therefore,\\neven modest efforts like standing at the desk and doing gentle\\nstretching for periods during the day may be beneficial. It is also\\nimportant to emphasize that participating in a variety of aerobic\\nactivities (biking, swimming, walking, jogging, rowing, elliptical\\ntraining, stair-climbing, etc.) can be beneficial and may help to avoid\\noveruse injuries and boredom with the exercise regimen.

An individual may be fully vaccinated but still be hesitant\\nabout the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, or an individual may\\nbe unvaccinated as a result of access issues but may not be\\nhesitant. Therefore, in attempts to understand a patient’s lack of\\nvaccination, it is important to distinguish persons who are hesitant\\nand refuse vaccines from those who need assistance to access the\\nhealth care system and successfully complete vaccination. To this\\nend, an understanding of vaccine hesitancy and its determinants is\\nneeded.\\nVaccine hesitancy and opposition are defined by the World\\nHealth Organization’s SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy\\nas a “delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability\\nof vaccination services.” The SAGE group describes vaccine\\nhesitancy as “complex and context specific, varying across time,\\nplace, and vaccines.”\\nIt is useful to frame vaccine acceptance as a continuum pyramid,\\nwith active demand for all vaccines representing the largest group at\\nthe bottom of the pyramid and outright refusal of all vaccines\\ndepicted in the smallest group at the top. In the middle lies vaccine\\nhesitancy, in which the degree of vaccine demand and acceptance\\nvaries. Fortunately, for disease control efforts, most individuals fall\\nwithin the active-demand category or, if they are hesitant, still accept\\nall vaccines. Hesitancy can be influenced by complacency,\\nconvenience, and confidence (Fig. 3-1).'),\n",

A U.S. study\\nfound that socially disadvantaged individuals were more likely than\\nother persons to be under-vaccinated, in part because of a lack of\\naccess to health care services. HCPs must recognize that socially\\ndisadvantaged individuals and populations are often at greater risk of\\nvaccine-preventable diseases (e.g., as a result of crowded living\\nconditions, limited access to sanitation, poor nutrition, or substance\\nabuse) and also at greater risk of being under-vaccinated because\\nthey have limited access to health care services. In addition, specific\\nvaccines may be recommended for some socially disadvantaged\\npopulations or communities. For example, in the wake of several\\noutbreaks of hepatitis A among the U.S. homeless population, the\\nCDC now recommends that everyone >1 year of age experiencing\\nhomelessness receive hepatitis A vaccine.\\nDepending on the setting and the patient, some recommended\\nvaccines may not be covered through public funding or private\\ninsurance coverage.

While resistance is often framed as uncertainty about a\\nvaccine’s “newness,” further discussion translates this uncertainty\\ninto concern about the new vaccine’s safety. This concern\\nencompasses both short- and long-term side effects. Frequent,\\nacute adverse effects can be captured in clinical trial data, whereas\\nworries about rare and long-term side effects can be addressed only\\nby direct evidence after the initiation of a new vaccination program.\\nIn addition to queries about the overall safety of the vaccine, HCPs'),\n",

What\\nmakes medical practice so difficult is not only the specialized\\ntechnical knowledge required but also the intrinsic uncertainty that\\nsurrounds each decision. Mastering the technical aspects of\\nmedicine alone, unfortunately, does not ensure a mastery of the\\npractice of medicine. Sir William Osler’s familiar quote “Medicine is a\\nscience of uncertainty and an art of probability” captures well this\\ncomplex duality. Although the science of medicine is often taught as\\nif the mechanisms of the human body operate with Newtonian\\npredictability, every aspect of medical practice is infused with an\\nelement of irreducible uncertainty that the clinician ignores at her\\nperil. Although deeply rooted in science, more than 100 years after\\nthe practice of medicine took its modern form, it remains at its core a\\ncraft, to which individual doctors bring varying levels of skill and\\nunderstanding. With the exponential growth in medical literature and\\nother technical information and an ever-increasing number of testing\\nand treatment options, twenty-first century physicians who seek\\nexcellence in their craft must master a more diverse and complex set\\nof skills than any of the generations that preceded them. This\\nchapter provides an introduction to three of the pillars upon which\\nthe craft of modern medicine rests: (1) expertise in clinical reasoning\\n(what it is and how it can be developed); (2) rational diagnostic test\\nuse and interpretation; and (3) integration of the best available\\nresearch evidence with clinical judgment in the care of individual\\npatients (evidence-based medicine [EBM]).\\n■ BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO CLINICAL REASONING\\nClinical Expertise Defining “clinical expertise” remains surprisingly\\ndifficult.

In contrast, Analysis (System 2), the other form of\\nreasoning in the dual-process model, is slow, methodical,\\ndeliberative, and effortful. A student might read about causes of hilar\\nadenopathy and from that list (e.g., Chap. 66), identify diseases\\nmore common in black women or examine the patient for skin or eye\\nfindings that occur with sarcoid.

Differing practice styles\\nmay be based on training, personal experience, and medical\\nevidence. Beliefs about effectiveness of different therapies and\\npreferred patterns of diagnostic test use are examples of different\\nfacets of a practice style.

For a 41-\\nyear-old man with nonanginal pain and a 10% pretest probability of\\nCAD, the posttest probability of disease after a positive result rises to\\nonly ∼ 30%. For a 60-year-old woman with typical angina and a\\npretest probability of CAD of 80%, a positive test result raises the\\nposttest probability of disease to ∼ 95%.\\nIn contrast, exercise SPECT myocardial perfusion test is more\\naccurate for diagnosis of CAD. For simplicity, assume that the finding\\nof a reversible exercise-induced perfusion defect has both a\\nsensitivity and a specificity of 90% (a bit higher than reported),\\nyielding a likelihood ratio for a positive test of 9.0 (0.90/[1 – 0.90])\\n(consistent with intermediate discriminatory ability because it falls\\nbetween 5 and 10). For the same 10% pretest probability patient, a\\npositive test raises the probability of CAD to 50% (Fig. 4-2).\\nHowever, despite the differences in posttest probabilities between\\nthese two tests (30 vs 50%), the more accurate test may not improve\\ndiagnostic likelihood enough to change patient management (e.g.,\\ndecision to refer to cardiac catheterization) because the more\\naccurate test has only moved the physician from being fairly certain\\nthat the patient did not have CAD to a 50:50 chance of disease.

Conversely, with a high pretest probability, a negative\\ntest may not rule out disease adequately if it is not sufficiently\\nsensitive. Thus, the largest change in diagnostic likelihood following\\na test result occurs when the clinician is most uncertain (i.e., pretest\\nprobability between 30 and 70%).

Third, the primary objective of guidelines is to improve\\nthe quality of medical care by identifying care practices that should\\nbe routinely implemented, based on high-quality evidence and high\\nbenefit-to-harm ratios for the interventions. Guidelines are intended\\nto “assist” decision-making, not to define explicitly what decisions\\nshould be made in a particular situation, in part because guideline-\\nlevel evidence alone is never sufficient for clinical decision-making\\n(e.g., deciding whether to intubate and administer antibiotics for\\npneumonia in a terminally ill individual, in an individual with\\ndementia, or in an otherwise healthy 30-year-old mother).\\nGuidelines are narrative documents constructed by expert panels\\nwhose composition often is determined by interested professional\\norganizations.

The guideline\\ndocuments consist of a series of specific management\\nrecommendations, a summary indication of the quantity and quality\\nof evidence supporting each recommendation, an assessment of the\\nbenefit-to-harm ratio for the recommendation, and a narrative\\ndiscussion of the recommendations. Many recommendations simply\\nreflect the expert consensus of the guideline panel because\\nliterature-based evidence is insufficient or absent. A recent\\nexamination of this issue in cardiovascular guidelines showed that\\n<15% of guideline recommendations were based on the highest\\nlevel of clinical trial evidence, and this proportion had not improved in\\n10 years despite a substantial number of trials being conducted and\\npublished.

In this rubric, the definition of any\\ndisease is largely based on clinicopathologic observation. As the\\ncorrelation between clinical signs and symptoms with pathoanatomy\\nrequired autopsy material, diseases tended to be characterized by\\nthe end organ in which the primary syndrome was manifest and by\\nlate-stage presentations. Morgagni institutionalized this framework\\nwith the publication of De Sedibus et Causis Morborum per\\nAnatomen Indagatis in 1761, in which he correlated the clinical\\nfeatures of patients with more than 600 autopsies at the University of\\nPadua, demonstrating an anatomic basis for disease\\npathophysiology. Clinicopathologic observation served as the basis\\nfor inductive generalization coupled with the application of Occam’s\\nrazor in which disease complexity was reduced to its simplest\\npossible form. While this approach to defining human disease has\\nheld sway for over a century and facilitated the conquest of many\\ndiseases previously considered incurable, overly inclusive and\\nsimplified Oslerian diagnostics suffer from significant shortcomings.\\nThese include, but are not limited to, failure to distinguish the\\nunderlying etiology of different diseases with common\\npathophenotypes. For example, many different diseases can cause\\nend-stage kidney disease or heart failure. Over time, the\\nclassification of neurodegenerative disorders or lymphomas, as well\\nas many other diseases, is becoming more refined and precise as\\nthe underlying etiologies are identified. These distinctions are\\nimportant for providing predictable prognostic information for\\nindividual patients with even highly prevalent diseases. Additionally,\\ntherapies may be ineffective owing to a lack of understanding of the\\noften subtle molecular complexities of specific disease drivers.'),\n",

Armstrong, Gary J. Martin\\nA primary goal of health care is to prevent disease or detect it early\\nenough that intervention will be more effective. Tremendous\\nprogress has been made toward this goal over the past 50 years.\\nScreening tests are available for many common diseases and\\nencompass biochemical (e.g., cholesterol, glucose), physiologic\\n(e.g., blood pressure, growth curves), radiologic (e.g., mammogram,\\nbone densitometry), and cytologic (e.g., Pap smear) approaches.\\nEffective preventive interventions have resulted in dramatic declines\\nin mortality from many diseases, particularly infections. Preventive\\ninterventions include counseling about risk behaviors, vaccinations,\\nmedications, and, in some relatively uncommon settings, surgery.\\nPreventive services (including screening tests, preventive\\ninterventions, and counseling) are different than other medical\\ninterventions because they are proactively administered to healthy\\nindividuals instead of in response to a symptom, sign, or diagnosis.\\nThus, the decision to recommend a screening test or preventive\\nintervention requires a particularly high bar of evidence that testing\\nand intervention are both practical and effective.\\n Because population-based screening and prevention\\nstrategies must be extremely low risk to have an acceptable benefit-\\nto-harm ratio, the ability to target individuals who are more likely to\\ndevelop disease could enable the application of a wider set of\\npotential approaches and increase efficiency. Currently, there are\\nmany types of data that can predict disease incidence in an\\nasymptomatic individual. Germline genomic data have received the\\nmost attention to date, at least in part because mutations in high-\\npenetrance genes have clear implications for preventive care (Chap.'),\n",

Women with mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2, the two\\nmajor breast cancer susceptibility genes identified to date, have a\\nmarkedly increased risk (five- to twentyfold) of breast and ovarian\\ncancer. Screening and prevention recommendations include\\nprophylactic oophorectomy and breast magnetic resonance imaging\\n(MRI), both of which are considered to incur too much harm for\\nwomen at average cancer risk. Some women with BRCA mutations\\nopt for prophylactic mastectomy to dramatically reduce their breast\\ncancer risk. Although the proportion of common disease explained\\nby high-penetrance genes appears to be relatively small (5–10% of\\nmost diseases), mutations in rare, moderate-penetrance genes, and\\nvariants in low-penetrance genes, also contribute to the prediction of\\ndisease risk. Most recently, polygenic risk scores combining\\ninformation about variants across hundreds of genes are being\\nevaluated for identifying individuals at high risk of coronary heart\\ndisease and other conditions. The advent of affordable whole\\nexome/whole genome sequencing is likely to speed the\\ndissemination of these tests into clinical practice and may transform\\nthe delivery of preventive care.\\nOther forms of “omic” data also have the potential to provide\\nimportant predictive information. Proteomics and metabolomics can\\nprovide insight into gene function, but it has proven challenging to\\ndevelop reliable, predictive measures using these platforms. More\\nrecently, it has become possible to measure the presence of\\nmutations in DNA circulating in the bloodstream and in stool, with\\nearly promising evidence that these assays can be used to detect\\ncancer before existing screening tests.\\nIn addition to “omic” data, imaging data are increasingly being\\nintegrated into risk-stratified prevention approaches as evidence\\ngrows about the predictive ability of these data. For example,\\ncoronary computed tomography (CT) scans are used in many\\npreventive cardiology programs to inform decisions about beginning\\nstatin therapy when there is conflicting or uncertain information from\\nother risk assessment approaches. Of course, these data may also\\nbe helpful in predicting the risk of harms from screening or\\nprevention, such as the risk of a false-positive mammogram.'),\n",

For example, when there is a significant\\nfamily history of colon cancer, it is prudent to initiate screening 10\\nyears before the age at which the youngest family member was\\ndiagnosed with cancer.\\nAlthough informed consent is important for all aspects of medical\\ncare, shared decision-making may be a particularly important\\napproach to decisions about preventive services when the benefit-to-\\nharm ratio is uncertain for a specific population.

In developed countries, health systems\\nhave traditionally been classified by their type of financing—i.e.,\\neither predominantly tax-funded (such as the National Health Service\\nin England and publicly operated regional care systems in the four\\nEuropean Nordic countries) or predominantly statutory social health\\ninsurance (SHI)-funded (such as in Germany, the Netherlands, and\\nFrance). Over the past several decades, however, there has been\\nstructural convergence in the technical characteristics of both\\nfunding arrangements and in the associated delivery systems,\\nmaking analytic observations about differences across national\\nsystems more difficult.\\nA second confounding factor has been that former Soviet Bloc\\ncountries in Central and Eastern Europe, including the Russian\\nFederation, have, since 1991, replaced their former Soviet-style\\nSemashko models (a top-down, national government–controlled\\nfunding and delivery structure with a parallel Communist Party\\nadministrative apparatus) with various hybrid arrangements built on\\nnational government–run SHI financing. Distinctions across\\ndeveloped country health systems, especially in Europe, have been\\nfurther compressed by inadequate resources in many publicly\\nfunded systems in an era of rapid clinical and technological change,\\ntriggering increased private sector funding and provision.\\nIn middle-income developing countries, institutional structures in\\nthe health sector typically reflect the country’s preindependence\\nadministrative framework.

Institutional\\nmergers can be difficult to negotiate among publicly operated\\nhospitals, due to the role that these large institutions play as\\nimportant care providers and as large employers in smaller cities and\\ntowns, especially given political and union concerns about\\nmaintaining current employment levels.

Most state\\ngovernment Medicaid programs pay out more than 40% of their total\\nbudget for nursing home care. In the past, Medicaid did not pay for\\nhome care services. However, some states have programs with\\nprivate for-profit and not-for-profit providers that provide home care\\nas a way to forestall the need for the more expensive nursing home\\ncare.\\nMany private individuals take out private LTC insurance, typically\\nfrom commercial insurance companies. These policies require\\nindividuals to make premium payments for years in advance (often\\n20 or more) before the individual learns whether they will, in fact,\\nrequire home or nursing home care. Some private insurers have also\\nraised premiums after individuals have paid in for many years and\\ncanceled policies if the new higher rate is not affordable. The 2010\\nACA contained a new public LTC insurance program. However, the\\nprogram was designed to be voluntary, and U.S. Department of\\nHealth and Human Services administrators decided in 2013 not to\\nimplement that portion of the law.\\nIn addition to the tax-funded Medicaid program and privately\\npurchased LTC insurance, many middle-class families pay for care\\nfrom savings, by selling the elderly person’s home, or by direct\\ncontribution from children and other family members. Expenses can\\nreach between $60,000 and $100,000 per year depending on the\\nlocation of a facility and who operates it.\\nNursing home care in the United States is provided by a wide mix\\nof private not-for-profit and for-profit providers, ranging from church-'),\n",

Most European countries also use a number of\\ndifferent regulatory measures to limit prices and/or availability of both\\ninpatient and outpatient drugs, including mandatory generic\\nprescribing, reference pricing, patient copays (sometimes with an\\nannual ceiling, after which copayments are no longer required), and\\n(particularly in tax-funded systems) national formularies tied to\\nclinical effectiveness. Norway, for example, allows only about 2300\\ndifferent preparations—including dosage, delivery method, and box\\nsize—to be stocked by pharmacies. Prices for drugs can vary\\nconsiderably across different European countries, tied to economic\\ndevelopment and domestic pricing patterns. One consequence of\\nthese differential national pricing controls has been the development\\nof a parallel import market, in which drug wholesalers and\\npharmacists in the more expensive countries purchase supplies from\\na cheaper market elsewhere in Europe.\\nAccess to expensive drugs has also been intentionally limited in\\nsome tax-funded health systems in Europe.

Bates\\nSafety and quality are two of the central dimensions of health care.\\nIn recent years, it has become easier to measure safety and quality,\\nand it is increasingly clear that performance in both dimensions\\ncould be much better. The public is—with good justification—\\ndemanding measurement and accountability, and payment for\\nservices will increasingly be based on performance in these areas.\\nThus, physicians must learn about these two domains, how they can\\nbe improved, and the relative strengths and limitations of the current\\nability to measure them.\\nSafety and quality are closely related but do not completely\\noverlap. The Institute of Medicine has suggested in a seminal series\\nof reports that safety is the first part of quality and that the health\\ncare system must first and foremost guarantee that it will deliver safe\\ncare, although quality is also pivotal. In the end, it is likely that more\\nnet clinical benefit will be derived from improving quality than from\\nimproving safety, though both are important and safety is in many\\nways more tangible to the public. The first section of this chapter will\\naddress issues relating to the safety of care and the second will\\ncover quality of care.\\n■ SAFETY IN HEALTH CARE\\nSafety Theory and Systems Theory Safety theory clearly points\\nout that individuals make errors all the time. Think of driving home\\nfrom the hospital: you intend to stop and pick up a quart of milk on\\nthe way home but find yourself entering your driveway without\\nrealizing how you got there. Everybody uses low-level,\\nsemiautomatic behavior for many activities in daily life; this kind of\\nerror is called a slip. Slips occur often during care delivery—e.g.,\\nwhen people intend to write an order but forget because they must\\ncomplete another action first. Mistakes, by contrast, are errors of a\\nhigher level; they occur in new or nonstereotypic situations in which'),\n",

An example would be dosing\\nof a medication with which a physician is not familiar. The strategies\\nused to prevent slips and mistakes are often different.\\nSystems theory suggests that most accidents occur as the result\\nof a series of small failures that happen to line up in an individual\\ninstance so that an accident can occur (Fig. 8-1). It also suggests\\nthat most individuals in an industry such as health care are trying to\\ndo the right thing (e.g., deliver safe care) and that most accidents\\nthus result from defects in systems. Systems should be designed\\nboth to make errors less likely and to identify those that do inevitably\\noccur.\\nFIGURE 8-1 “Swiss cheese” diagram. Reason argues that most accidents occur\\nwhen a series of “latent failures” are present in a system and happen to line up in a\\ngiven instance, resulting in an accident. Examples of latent failures in the case of a\\nfall might be that the unit is unusually busy and the floor happens to be wet.\\n(Adapted from J Reason: BMJ 320:768, 2000.)\\nFactors That Increase the Likelihood of Errors Many factors\\nubiquitous in health care systems can increase the likelihood of\\nerrors, including fatigue, stress, interruptions, complexity, and\\ntransitions. The effects of fatigue in other industries are clear, but its\\neffects in health care have been more controversial until recently.

The National Quality Forum\\nhas released recommendations to U.S. hospitals about what\\npractices will most improve the safety of care, and all hospitals are\\nexpected to implement these recommendations. Many of these\\npractices arise frequently in routine care.

Patients\\npresent to doctors seeking an answer to the question, “What is\\nwrong with me?” Ideally, no clinician would want to treat a patient\\nwithout knowing the diagnosis or, worse yet, erroneously treat a\\nmisdiagnosed illness. From the earliest moments of medical school,\\nthe defining quest toward becoming a knowledgeable and proficient\\nphysician is learning how to put a diagnostic label on patients’\\nsymptoms and physical findings, and clinicians pride themselves on\\nbeing “good diagnosticians.” Yet the centuries-old paradigm of\\nmastering a long list of diseases, understanding their\\npathophysiology, and knowing the cardinal ways they manifest\\nthemselves in signs and symptoms, while still of fundamental\\nimportance, is being challenged by new insights illuminated by the\\nglaring spotlight of diagnostic errors. Basic internal medicine\\ndiseases, such as asthma, pulmonary embolism, congestive heart\\nfailure, seizures, strokes, ruptured aneurysms, depression, and\\ncancer, are misdiagnosed at shockingly high rates, often with 20–\\n50% of patients either being mislabeled as having these conditions\\n(false-positive diagnoses) or having their diagnosis missed or\\ndelayed (false negatives). How and why do physicians so often get it\\nwrong, and what can we do to both diagnose and treat the problem\\nof delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis?\\nDiagnosis is both an ancient art and a modern science. The\\ncurrent science of diagnosis, however, goes far beyond what\\ntypically comes to clinicians’ and patients’ minds when they conjure\\nup images of state-of-the-art molecular, genetic, or imaging\\ntechnologies. Improvements in diagnosis are just as likely to come\\nfrom other areas, many with origins outside of medicine, as they are\\nfrom advanced diagnostic testing modalities.

Reports from patient surveys, malpractice claims,\\nand safety organizations, such as the ECRI and the National Patient\\nSafety Foundation (now part of Institute for Healthcare\\nImprovement), have found that diagnostic errors are the leading type\\nof medical error. Although errors in diagnosis are defined in various\\nways, the NAM Committee defined diagnostic error as “the failure to\\n(a) establish an accurate and timely explanation of the patient’s\\nhealth problem(s) or (b) communicate that explanation to the\\npatient.” One way to visualize diagnostic errors is through a Venn\\ndiagram (Fig. 9-1), which illustrates the fact that many things can go\\nwrong in the diagnostic process (e.g., failure to ask an important\\nhistory question, physical examination sign overlooked, laboratory\\nspecimen erroneously switched between two patients, x-ray not'),\n",

Betancourt\\nOver the course of its history, the United States has experienced\\ndramatic improvements in overall health and life expectancy, largely\\nas a result of initiatives in public health, health promotion, disease\\nprevention, and chronic care management. Our ability to prevent,\\ndetect, and treat diseases in their early stages has allowed us to\\ntarget and reduce rates of morbidity and mortality. Despite\\ninterventions that have improved the overall health of the majority of\\nAmericans, racial and ethnic minorities (blacks, Hispanics/Latinos,\\nNative Americans/Alaskan Natives, Asian/Pacific Islanders) have\\nbenefited less from these advances than whites and have suffered\\npoorer health outcomes from many major diseases, including\\ncardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. These disparities\\nhighlight the importance of recognizing and addressing the multiple\\nfactors that impact health outcomes, including structural racism,\\nsocial determinants of health (SDOH), access to care, and health\\ncare quality. On this last point, research has revealed that minorities\\nmay receive less care and lower-quality care than whites, even when\\nconfounders such as stage of presentation, comorbidities, and health\\ninsurance are controlled. These differences in quality are called\\nracial and ethnic disparities in health care. These health care\\ndisparities have taken on greater importance with the significant\\ntransformation of the U.S. health care system and value-based\\npurchasing. The shift toward creating financial incentives and\\ndisincentives to achieve quality goals makes focusing on those who\\nreceive lower-quality care more important than ever before. This\\nchapter will provide an overview of racial and ethnic disparities in\\nhealth and health care, identify root causes, and provide key\\nrecommendations to address these disparities at both the clinical\\nand health system levels.\\n■ NATURE AND EXTENT OF DISPARITIES'),\n",

Communication issues related to\\ndiscordant language disproportionately affect minorities and likely\\ncontribute to racial/ethnic disparities in health care.\\nCLINICAL DECISION-MAKING Theory and research suggest that\\nvariations in clinical decision-making may contribute to racial and\\nethnic disparities in health care. Two factors are central to this\\nprocess: clinical uncertainty and stereotyping.\\nFirst, a doctor’s decision-making process is nested in clinical\\nuncertainty. Doctors depend on inferences about severity based on\\nwhat they understand about illness and the information obtained\\nfrom the patient. A doctor caring for a patient whose symptoms he or\\nshe has difficulty understanding and whose “signals”—the set of\\nclues and indications that physicians rely on to make clinical\\ndecisions—are hard to read may make a decision different from the\\none that would be made for another patient who presents with\\nexactly the same clinical condition. Given that the expression of\\nsymptoms may differ among cultural and racial groups, doctors—the\\noverwhelming majority of whom are white—may understand\\nsymptoms best when expressed by patients of their own racial/ethnic\\ngroups. The consequence is that white patients may be treated\\ndifferently from minority patients. Differences in clinical decisions can\\narise from this mechanism even when the doctor has the same\\nregard for each patient (i.e., is not prejudiced).\\nSecond, the literature on social cognitive theory highlights how\\nnatural tendencies to stereotype may influence clinical decision-\\nmaking. Stereotyping can be defined as the way in which people use\\nsocial categories (e.g., race, gender, age) in acquiring, processing,\\nand recalling information about others. Faced with enormous\\ninformation loads and the need to make many decisions, people\\noften subconsciously simplify the decision-making process and\\nlessen cognitive effort by using “categories” or “stereotypes” that\\nbundle information into groups or types that can be processed more\\nquickly. Although functional, stereotyping can be systematically\\nbiased, as people are automatically classified into social categories\\nbased on dimensions such as race, gender, and age.

As signs of racism, classism, gender bias,\\nand ageism are experienced (consciously or unconsciously) in our\\nsociety, stereotypes may be created that impact the way doctors\\nmanage patients from these groups. On the basis of training or\\npractice location, doctors may develop certain perceptions about\\nrace/ethnicity, culture, and class that may evolve into stereotypes.\\nFor example, many medical students and residents are trained—and\\nminorities cared for—in academic health centers or public hospitals\\nlocated in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas.

Patients may request these and other\\ncomplex, highly technical, and expensive therapies for unproven\\nindications. Yet, claims of cures through unproven stem cell or gene-\\nbased “therapies” pose significant health and financial risks to\\npatients without evidence of benefit.

The epidemiology of death has changed significantly since\\n1900 and even since 1980. In 1900, heart disease caused ∼ 8% of all\\ndeaths, and cancer accounted for <4% of all deaths. In 1980, heart\\ndisease accounted for 38.2% of all deaths, cancer 20.9%, and\\ncerebrovascular disease 8.6% of all deaths. By 2019, there had\\nbeen a dramatic drop in deaths from cardiovascular and\\ncerebrovascular diseases. In 2019, 23.1% of all deaths were from\\ncardiovascular disease and just 5.3% from cerebrovascular disease.\\nDeaths attributable to cancer, however, had increased slightly to\\n21.0%. The proportions of deaths due to chronic lower respiratory\\ndisease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, and suicide have increased.\\nInterestingly, in 2019, HIV/AIDS accounted for <0.18% of all U.S.\\ndeaths. While unlikely to continue being a leading cause of death in\\nthe future, COVID-19 was also the cause for >600,000 deaths in\\n2020–2021, and the official figure is almost certainly an undercount\\nof the actual death toll.\\nTABLE 12-1 Ten Leading Causes of Death in the United States\\nand Britain'),\n",

Since patients’ preferences\\ncan change, these documents must be reviewed periodically.\\nTYPES OF DOCUMENTS Advance care planning documents are of two\\nbroad types. The first includes living wills, also known as\\ninstructional directives; these are advisory documents that describe\\nthe types of decisions that should direct a patient’s care. Some are\\nmore specific, delineating different scenarios and interventions for\\nthe patient to choose from. Among these, some are for general use\\nand others are designed for use by patients with a specific type of\\ndisease, such as cancer, renal failure, or HIV. Less specific directives\\ncan be general statements, such as not wanting life-sustaining\\ninterventions, or forms that describe the values that should guide\\nspecific discussions about terminal care. The second type of\\nadvance directive allows the designation of a health care proxy\\n(sometimes also referred to as a durable attorney for health care), an\\nindividual selected by the patient to make decisions. The choice is\\nnot either/or; a combined directive that includes a living will and\\ndesignates a proxy is often used, and the directive should indicate\\nclearly whether the specified patient preferences or the proxy’s\\nchoice takes precedence if they conflict. Some states have begun to\\nput into practice a “Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment\\n(POLST)” directive, which builds on communication between\\nproviders and patients by including guidance for end-of-life care in a\\ncolor-coordinated form that follows the patient across treatment\\nsettings. The procedures for completing advance care planning\\ndocuments vary according to state law.\\nA potentially misleading distinction relates to statutory, as\\nopposed to advisory, documents. Statutory documents are drafted to\\nfulfill relevant state laws. Advisory documents are drafted to reflect\\nthe patient’s wishes.

Medical\\ntreatments for nausea are aimed at receptors at each of these sites:\\nthe GI tract contains mechanoreceptors, chemoreceptors, and 5-\\nhydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptors; the vestibular system\\nprobably contains histamine and acetylcholine receptors; and the\\nCTZ contains chemoreceptors, dopamine type 2 receptors, and 5-\\nHT3 receptors. An example of nausea that most likely is mediated by\\nthe cortex is anticipatory nausea before a dose of chemotherapy or\\nother noxious stimuli.\\nSpecific causes of nausea include metabolic changes (liver\\nfailure, uremia from renal failure, hypercalcemia), bowel obstruction,\\nconstipation, infection, GERD, vestibular disease, brain metastases,\\nmedications (including antibiotics, NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitors,\\nopioids, and chemotherapy), and radiation therapy. Anxiety can also\\ncontribute to nausea.\\nINTERVENTION Medical treatment of nausea is directed at the\\nanatomic and receptor-mediated cause revealed by a careful history\\nand physical examination.

When inflammation of\\nthe GI tract is suspected, glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone,\\nare an appropriate treatment. For nausea that follows chemotherapy\\nand radiation therapy, one of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists or\\nneurokinin-1 antagonists, such as aprepitant or fosaprepitant, is\\nrecommended.

In addition to low caloric\\nintake, loss of muscle mass and changes in muscle enzymes may\\nplay an important role in fatigue during terminal illness. The\\nimportance of changes in the CNS, especially the reticular activating\\nsystem, have been hypothesized based on reports of fatigue in\\npatients receiving cranial radiation, experiencing depression, or\\nhaving chronic pain in the absence of cachexia or other physiologic\\nchanges. Finally, depression and other causes of psychological\\ndistress can contribute to fatigue.\\nASSESSMENT Like pain and dyspnea, fatigue is subjective, as it\\nrepresents a patient’s sense of tiredness and decreased capacity for\\nphysical work. Objective changes, even in body mass, may be\\nabsent. Consequently, assessment must rely on patient self-\\nreporting. Scales used to measure fatigue, such as the Edmonton\\nFunctional Assessment Tool, the Fatigue Self-Report Scales, and the\\nRhoten Fatigue Scale, are usually appropriate for research but not\\nclinical purposes. In clinical practice, a simple performance\\nassessment such as the Karnofsky performance status or the\\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)’s question “How\\nmuch of the day does the patient spend in bed?” may be the best\\nmeasure.

This is known as financial toxicity. In the United States,\\nwhich has the least comprehensive health insurance systems among\\nwealthy countries, a quarter of families coping with end-stage cancer\\nreport that care was a major financial burden and a third used up\\nmost of their savings. Among Medicare beneficiaries, average out-of-\\npocket costs were >$8000. Between 10% and 30% of families are\\nforced to sell assets, use savings, or take out a mortgage to pay for\\nthe patient’s health care costs.\\nThe patient is likely to reduce hours worked and eventually stop\\nworking altogether. In 20% of cases, a family member of the\\nterminally ill patient also must stop working to provide care. The\\nmajor underlying causes of economic burden are related to poor\\nphysical functioning and care needs, such as the need for\\nhousekeeping, nursing, and personal care. More debilitated patients\\nand poor patients experience greater economic burdens.\\nINTERVENTION The economic burden of end-of-life care should not be\\nignored as a private matter.

In the United States, slightly more than a\\nthird—35.7%—of hospice care is provided in private residential\\nhomes with 14.5% of hospice care in nursing homes. In the United\\nStates, Medicare pays for hospice services under Part A, the\\nhospital insurance part of reimbursement. Two physicians must\\ncertify that the patient has a prognosis of ≤6 months if the disease\\nruns its usual course. Prognoses are probabilistic by their nature;\\npatients are not required to die within 6 months but rather to have a\\ncondition from which half the individuals with it would not be alive\\nwithin 6 months. Patients sign a hospice enrollment form that states\\ntheir intent to forgo curative services related to their terminal illness\\nbut can still receive medical services for other comorbid conditions.\\nPatients also can withdraw enrollment and reenroll later; the hospice\\nMedicare benefit can be revoked later to secure traditional Medicare\\nbenefits. Payments to the hospice are per diem (or capitated), not\\nfee-for-service. Payments are intended to cover physician services\\nfor the medical direction of the care team; regular home care visits\\nby registered nurses and licensed practical nurses; home health aide\\nand homemaker services; chaplain services; social work services;\\nbereavement counseling; and medical equipment, supplies, and\\nmedications. No specific therapy is excluded, and the goal is for\\neach therapy to be considered for its symptomatic (as opposed to\\ndisease-modifying) effect.

The current legal\\nconsensus in the United States and most wealthy countries is that\\npatients have a moral as well as legal right to refuse medical\\ninterventions. American courts also have held that incompetent\\npatients have a right to refuse medical interventions.

In theory, patients’ right to refuse medical therapy can\\nbe limited by four countervailing interests: (1) preservation of life, (2)\\nprevention of suicide, (3) protection of third parties such as children,\\nand (4) preservation of the integrity of the medical profession. In\\npractice, these interests almost never override the right of competent\\npatients and incompetent patients who have left explicit wishes or\\nadvance care directives.\\nFor incompetent patients who either appointed a proxy without\\nspecific indications of their wishes or never completed an advance\\ncare directive, three criteria have been suggested to guide the\\ndecision to terminate medical interventions. First, some\\ncommentators suggest that ordinary care should be administered but\\nextraordinary care could be terminated. Because the\\nordinary/extraordinary distinction is too vague, courts and\\ncommentators widely agree that it should not be used to justify\\ndecisions about stopping treatment.

However,\\nmultiple studies indicate that many proxies, even close family\\nmembers, cannot accurately predict what the patient would have\\nwanted. Therefore, substituted judgment becomes more of a\\nguessing game than a way of fulfilling the patient’s wishes. Finally,\\nthe best-interests criterion holds that proxies should evaluate\\ntreatments by balancing their benefits and risks and select those\\ntreatments where the benefits maximally outweigh the burdens of\\ntreatment. Clinicians have a clear and crucial role in this by carefully\\nand dispassionately explaining the known benefits and burdens of\\nspecific treatments. Yet even when that information is as clear as\\npossible, different individuals can have very different views of what is\\nin the patient’s best interests, and families may have disagreements\\nor even overt conflicts. This criterion has been criticized because\\nthere is no single way to determine the balance between benefits\\nand burdens; it depends on a patient’s personal values. For\\ninstance, for some people, being alive even if mentally incapacitated\\nis a benefit, whereas for others, it may be the worst possible\\nexistence. As a matter of practice, physicians rely on family\\nmembers to make decisions that they feel are best and object only if\\nthose decisions seem to demand treatments that the physicians\\nconsider not beneficial.\\nPractices Withholding and withdrawing acutely life-sustaining\\nmedical interventions from terminally ill patients are now standard\\npractice. More than 90% of American patients die without\\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and just as many forgo other\\npotentially life-sustaining interventions. For instance, in ICUs in the\\nperiod of 1987–1988, CPR was performed 49% of the time, but it\\nwas performed only 10% of the time in 1992–1993 and on just 1.8%\\nof admissions from 2001 to 2008. On average, 3.8 interventions,\\nsuch as vasopressors and transfusions, were stopped for each dying\\nICU patient. However, up to 19% of decedents in hospitals received\\ninterventions such as extubation, ventilation, and surgery in the 48 h\\npreceding death.

The two approaches are terminal extubation, which is\\nthe removal of the endotracheal tube, and terminal weaning, which is\\nthe gradual reduction of the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) or\\nventilator rate. One-third of ICU physicians prefer to use the terminal\\nweaning technique, and 13% extubate; the majority of physicians\\nutilize both techniques. The American Thoracic Society’s 2008\\nclinical policy guidelines note that there is no single correct process\\nof ventilator withdrawal and that physicians use and should be\\nproficient in both methods but that the chosen approach should\\ncarefully balance benefits and burdens as well as patient and\\ncaregiver preferences. Some recommend terminal weaning because\\npatients do not develop upper airway obstruction and the distress\\ncaused by secretions or stridor; however, terminal weaning can\\nprolong the dying process and not allow a patient’s family to be with\\nthe patient unencumbered by an endotracheal tube. To ensure\\ncomfort for conscious or semiconscious patients before withdrawal of\\nthe ventilator, neuromuscular blocking agents should be terminated\\nand sedatives and analgesics administered. Removing the\\nneuromuscular blocking agents permits patients to show discomfort,\\nfacilitating the titration of sedatives and analgesics; it also permits\\ninteractions between patients and their families. A common practice\\nis to inject a bolus of midazolam (2–4 mg) or lorazepam (2–4 mg)\\nbefore withdrawal, followed by a bolus of 5–10 mg of morphine and\\ncontinuous infusion of morphine (50% of the bolus dose per hour)\\nduring weaning.

Although no objective definition or\\nstandard of futility exists, several categories have been proposed.\\nPhysiologic futility means that an intervention will have no\\nphysiologic effect. Some have defined qualitative futility as applying\\nto procedures that “fail to end a patient’s total dependence on\\nintensive medical care.” Quantitative futility occurs “when physicians\\nconclude (through personal experience, experiences shared with\\ncolleagues, or consideration of reported empiric data) that in the last\\n100 cases, a medical treatment has been useless.” The term\\nconceals subjective value judgments about when a treatment is “not\\nbeneficial.” Deciding whether a treatment that obtains an additional 6\\nweeks of life or a 1% survival advantage confers benefit depends on\\npatients’ preferences and goals. Furthermore, physicians’ predictions\\nof when treatments are futile deviate markedly from the quantitative\\ndefinition. When residents thought CPR was quantitatively futile,\\nmore than one in five patients had a >10% chance of survival to\\nhospital discharge. Most studies that purport to guide determinations\\nof futility are based on insufficient data and therefore cannot provide\\nstatistical confidence for clinical decision-making. Quantitative futility\\nrarely applies in ICU settings.\\nMany commentators reject using futility as a criterion for\\nwithdrawing care, preferring instead to consider futility situations as\\nones that represent conflict that calls for careful negotiation between\\nfamilies and health care providers. The American Medical\\nAssociation and other professional societies have developed\\nprocess-based approaches to resolving cases clinicians feel are\\nfutile. These process-based measures mainly suggest involving\\nconsultants and/or ethics committees when there are seemingly\\nirresolvable differences. Some hospitals have enacted “unilateral do-'),\n",

This type of a policy is not a replacement for careful\\nand patient communication and negotiation but recognizes that\\nagreement cannot always be reached.\\nIn 1999, Texas enacted the so-called Futile Care Act. Other\\nstates, such as Virginia, Maryland, and California, have also enacted\\nsuch laws that provide physicians a “safe harbor” from liability if they\\nrefuse a patient’s or family’s request for life-sustaining interventions.\\nFor instance, in Texas, when a disagreement about terminating\\ninterventions between the medical team and the family has not been\\nresolved by an ethics consultation, the physician is tasked with trying\\nto facilitate transfer of the patient to an institution willing to provide\\ntreatment. If this fails after 10 days, the hospital and physician may\\nunilaterally withdraw treatments determined to be futile. The family\\nmay appeal to a state court. Early data suggest that the law\\nincreases futility consultations for the ethics committee and that,\\nalthough most families concur with withdrawal, ∼ 10–15% of families\\nrefuse to withdraw treatment. As of 2007, there had been 974 ethics\\ncommittee consultations on medical futility cases and 65 in which\\ncommittees ruled against families and gave notice that treatment\\nwould be terminated. In 2007, a survey of Texas hospitals showed\\nthat 30% of hospitals had used the futility law in 213 adult cases and\\n42 pediatric cases.

The function of the pain sensory system is to protect the\\nbody and maintain homeostasis. It does this by detecting, localizing,\\nand identifying potential or actual tissue-damaging processes.\\nBecause different diseases produce characteristic patterns of tissue\\ndamage, the quality, time course, and location of a patient’s pain\\nlend important diagnostic clues. It is the physician’s responsibility to\\nassess each patient promptly for any remediable cause underlying\\nthe pain and to provide rapid and effective pain relief whenever\\npossible.\\nTHE PAIN SENSORY SYSTEM\\nPain is an unpleasant sensation localized to a part of the body. It is\\noften described in terms of a penetrating or tissue-destructive\\nprocess (e.g., stabbing, burning, twisting, tearing, squeezing) and/or\\nof a bodily or emotional reaction (e.g., terrifying, nauseating,\\nsickening). Furthermore, any pain of moderate or higher intensity is\\naccompanied by anxiety and the urge to escape or terminate the\\nfeeling. These properties illustrate the duality of pain: it is both\\nsensation and emotion. When it is acute, pain is characteristically\\nassociated with behavioral arousal and a stress response consisting\\nof increased blood pressure, heart rate, pupil diameter, and plasma\\ncortisol levels. In addition, local muscle contraction (e.g., limb flexion,\\nabdominal wall rigidity) is often present.\\n■ PERIPHERAL MECHANISMS'),\n",

Several general principles should guide therapy: the first is to\\nmove quickly to provide relief, and the second is to minimize drug\\nside effects. For example, in patients with postherpetic neuralgia\\nand significant cutaneous hypersensitivity, topical lidocaine\\n(Lidoderm patches) can provide immediate relief without side\\neffects. The anticonvulsants gabapentin or pregabalin (see above)\\nor antidepressants (nortriptyline, desipramine, duloxetine, or\\nvenlafaxine) can be used as first-line drugs for patients with\\nneuropathic pain. Systemically administered antiarrhythmic drugs\\nsuch as lidocaine and mexiletine are less likely to be effective.\\nAlthough intravenous infusion of lidocaine can provide analgesia for\\npatients with different types of neuropathic pain, the relief is usually\\ntransient, typically lasting just hours after the cessation of the\\ninfusion.

There is no\\nconsensus on which class of drug should be used as a first-line\\ntreatment for any chronically painful condition. However, because\\nrelatively high doses of anticonvulsants are required for pain relief,\\nsedation is not uncommon. Sedation is also a problem with TCAs\\nbut is much less of a problem with serotonin/norepinephrine\\nreuptake inhibitors (SNRIs; e.g., venlafaxine and duloxetine). Thus,\\nin the elderly or in patients whose daily activities require high-level\\nmental activity, these drugs should be considered the first line. In\\ncontrast, opioid medications should be used as a second- or third-\\nline drug class. Although highly effective for many painful\\nconditions, opioids are sedating, and their effect tends to lessen\\nover time, leading to dose escalation and, occasionally, a worsening\\nof pain.

Stable angina is characterized by ischemic episodes that\\nare typically precipitated by a superimposed increase in oxygen\\ndemand during physical exertion and relieved upon resting.

Certain disease processes, such as embolism or thrombosis\\nof the superior mesenteric artery or impending rupture of an\\nabdominal aortic aneurysm, can certainly be associated with diffuse,\\nsevere pain. Yet, just as frequently, the patient with occlusion of the\\nsuperior mesenteric artery only has mild continuous or cramping\\ndiffuse pain for 2 or 3 days before vascular collapse or findings of\\nperitoneal inflammation appear. The early, seemingly insignificant\\ndiscomfort is caused by hyperperistalsis rather than peritoneal\\ninflammation. Indeed, absence of tenderness and rigidity in the\\npresence of continuous, diffuse pain (e.g., “pain out of proportion to\\nphysical findings”) in a patient likely to have vascular disease is quite\\ncharacteristic of occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery.\\nAbdominal pain with radiation to the sacral region, flank, or genitalia\\nshould always signal the possible presence of a rupturing abdominal\\naortic aneurysm. This pain may persist over a period of several days\\nbefore rupture and collapse occur.\\nAbdominal Wall Pain arising from the abdominal wall is usually\\nconstant and aching. Movement, prolonged standing, and pressure\\naccentuate the discomfort and associated muscle spasm. In the\\nrelatively rare case of hematoma of the rectus sheath, now most\\nfrequently encountered in association with anticoagulant therapy, a\\nmass may be present in the lower quadrants of the abdomen.\\nSimultaneous involvement of muscles in other parts of the body\\nusually serves to differentiate myositis of the abdominal wall from\\nother processes that might cause pain in the same region.\\n■ REFERRED PAIN IN ABDOMINAL DISEASE\\nPain referred to the abdomen from the thorax, spine, or genitalia\\nmay present a diagnostic challenge because diseases of the upper\\npart of the abdominal cavity such as acute cholecystitis or perforated\\nulcer may be associated with intrathoracic complications. A most\\nimportant, yet often forgotten, dictum is that the possibility of\\nintrathoracic disease must be considered in every patient with\\nabdominal pain, especially if the pain is in the upper abdomen.'),\n",

Engstrom\\nThe importance of back and neck pain in our society is underscored\\nby the following: (1) the cost of chronic back pain in the United\\nStates is estimated at more than $200 billion annually; approximately\\none-third of this cost is due to direct health care expenses and two-\\nthirds are indirect costs resulting from loss of wages and productivity;\\n(2) back symptoms are the most common cause of disability in\\nindividuals <45 years of age; (3) low back pain (LBP) is the second\\nmost common reason for visiting a physician in the United States;\\nand (4) more than four out of five people will experience significant\\nback pain at some point in their lives.\\nANATOMY OF THE SPINE\\nThe anterior spine consists of cylindrical vertebral bodies separated\\nby intervertebral disks and stabilized by the anterior and posterior\\nlongitudinal ligaments. The intervertebral disks are composed of a\\ncentral gelatinous nucleus pulposus surrounded by a tough\\ncartilaginous ring, the annulus fibrosis. Disks are responsible for\\n25% of spinal column length and allow the bony vertebrae to move\\neasily upon each other (Figs. 17-1 and 17-2). Desiccation of the\\nnucleus pulposus and degeneration of the annulus fibrosus worsen\\nwith age, resulting in loss of disk height. The disks are largest in the\\ncervical and lumbar regions where movements of the spine are\\ngreatest. The anterior spine absorbs the shock of bodily movements\\nsuch as walking and running, and with the posterior spine protects\\nthe spinal cord and nerve roots in the spinal canal.'),\n",

Local\\nsigns (pain with spine palpation, paraspinal muscle spasm) are\\nabsent, and little or no pain accompanies routine movements.\\nLow Thoracic or Lumbar Pain with Abdominal Disease Tumors\\nof the posterior wall of the stomach or duodenum typically produce\\nepigastric pain (Chaps. 80 and 324), but back pain may occur if\\nretroperitoneal extension is present. Fatty foods occasionally induce\\nback pain associated with biliary or pancreatic disease. Pathology in\\nretroperitoneal structures (hemorrhage, tumors, and pyelonephritis)\\ncan produce paraspinal pain that radiates to the lower abdomen,\\ngroin, or anterior thighs. A mass in the iliopsoas region can produce\\nunilateral lumbar pain with radiation toward the groin, labia, or\\ntesticle. The sudden appearance of lumbar pain in a patient\\nreceiving anticoagulants should prompt consideration of\\nretroperitoneal hemorrhage.\\nIsolated LBP occurs in some patients with a contained rupture of\\nan AAA. The classic clinical triad of abdominal pain, shock, and back\\npain occurs in <20% of patients. The diagnosis may be missed\\nbecause the symptoms and signs can be nonspecific. Misdiagnoses\\ninclude nonspecific back pain, diverticulitis, renal colic, sepsis, and\\nmyocardial infarction. A careful abdominal examination revealing a\\npulsatile mass (present in 50–75% of patients) is an important\\nphysical finding. Patients with suspected AAA should be evaluated\\nwith abdominal ultrasound, CT, or MRI (Chap. 280).\\nSacral Pain with Gynecologic and Urologic Disease Pelvic\\norgans rarely cause isolated LBP.

An ulcer is a defect\\nin the skin extending at least into the upper layer of the dermis,\\nand an eschar (tâche noire) is a necrotic lesion covered with a\\nblack crust.\\nOther pertinent features of rashes include their configuration\\n(i.e., annular or target), the arrangement of their lesions, and their\\ndistribution (i.e., central or peripheral).\\nFor further discussion, see Chaps. 56, 58, 122, and 129.\\n■ CLASSIFICATION OF RASH\\nThis chapter reviews rashes that reflect systemic disease, but it does\\nnot include localized skin eruptions (i.e., cellulitis, impetigo) that may\\nalso be associated with fever (Chap. 129). The chapter is not\\nintended to be all-inclusive, but it covers the most important and\\nmost common diseases associated with fever and rash. Rashes are\\nclassified herein on the basis of lesion morphology and distribution.\\nFor practical purposes, this classification system is based on the\\nmost typical disease presentations. However, morphology may vary\\nas rashes evolve, and the presentation of diseases with rashes is\\nsubject to many variations (Chap. 58). For instance, the classic\\npetechial rash of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (Chap. 187) may\\ninitially consist of blanchable erythematous macules distributed\\nperipherally; at times, however, the rash associated with this disease\\nmay not be predominantly acral, or no rash may develop at all.\\nDiseases with fever and rash may be classified by type of\\neruption: centrally distributed maculopapular, peripheral, confluent'),\n",

Bleeker-Rovers, Catharina M. Mulders-\\nManders, Jos W. M. van der Meer\\n■ DEFINITION\\nClinicians commonly refer to any febrile illness without an initially\\nobvious etiology as fever of unknown origin (FUO). Most febrile\\nillnesses either resolve before a diagnosis can be made or develop\\ndistinguishing characteristics that lead to a diagnosis. The term FUO\\nshould be reserved for prolonged febrile illnesses without an\\nestablished etiology despite intensive evaluation and diagnostic\\ntesting. This chapter focuses on FUO in the adult patient.\\nFUO was originally defined by Petersdorf and Beeson in 1961 as\\nan illness of >3 weeks’ duration with fever of ≥38.3°C (≥101°F) on\\ntwo occasions and an uncertain diagnosis despite 1 week of\\ninpatient evaluation. Nowadays, most patients with FUO are\\nhospitalized only if their clinical condition requires it, and not for\\ndiagnostic purposes alone; thus the in-hospital evaluation\\nrequirement has been eliminated from the definition. The definition of\\nFUO has been further modified by the exclusion of\\nimmunocompromised patients, whose workup requires an entirely\\ndifferent diagnostic and therapeutic approach. For optimal\\ncomparison of patients with FUO in different geographic areas, it has\\nbeen proposed that the quantitative criterion (diagnosis uncertain\\nafter 1 week of evaluation) be changed to a qualitative criterion that\\nrequires the performance of a specific list of investigations.\\nAccordingly, FUO is now defined as follows:\\n1. Fever ≥38.3°C (≥101°F) on at least two occasions\\n2. Illness duration of ≥3 weeks\\n3. No known immunocompromised state\\n4. Diagnosis that remains uncertain after a thorough history-taking,\\nphysical examination, and the following obligatory investigations:\\ndetermination of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-'),\n",

The proportion of cases caused by\\nintraabdominal abscesses and tumors, for example, has decreased\\nbecause of earlier detection by CT and ultrasound. In addition,\\ninfective endocarditis is a less frequent cause because blood culture\\nand echocardiographic techniques have improved. Conversely,\\nsome diagnoses such as acute HIV infection were unknown six\\ndecades ago.\\nRoughly comparable to 60 years ago, in non-Western cohorts\\ninfections remain the most common cause of FUO. Up to half of all\\ninfections in patients with FUO outside Western nations are caused\\nby Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is a less common cause in\\nWestern Europe and probably also in the United States. Recent data\\nfrom the latter, however, have not been reported. In Western cohorts,\\nnoninfectious inflammatory diseases (NIIDs), including autoimmune,\\nautoinflammatory, and granulomatous diseases, as well as\\nvasculitides, form the most common cause of FUO. More than one-\\nthird of Western patients with FUO have a diagnosis that falls within\\nthe category of NIIDs. The number of FUO patients diagnosed with\\nNIIDs probably will not decrease in the near future, as fever may\\nprecede more typical manifestations or laboratory evidence of these\\ndiseases by months. Moreover, many NIIDs can be diagnosed only\\nafter prolonged observation and exclusion of other diseases.\\nIn Western cohorts, FUO remains unexplained in more than one-\\nthird of patients. This is much higher than 60 years ago. This\\ndifference can be explained by the fact that in patients with fever a\\ndiagnosis is often established before 3 weeks have elapsed because\\nthese patients tend to seek medical advice earlier, and because\\nbetter diagnostic techniques, such as CT, MRI, and positron\\nemission tomography (PET)/CT, are now available. Therefore, only\\nthe cases that are most difficult to diagnose continue to meet the\\ncriteria for FUO. Furthermore, most patients who have FUO without\\na diagnosis currently do well. A less aggressive diagnostic approach\\nmay be used in clinically stable patients once diseases with\\nimmediate therapeutic or prognostic consequences have been ruled'),\n",

In patients with recurrent fever (defined as repeated episodes of\\nfever interspersed with fever-free intervals of at least 2 weeks and\\napparent remission of the underlying disease), the chance of\\nattaining an etiologic diagnosis is <50%.\\n■ DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nThe differential diagnosis for FUO is extensive. It is important to\\nremember that FUO is far more often caused by an atypical\\npresentation of a rather common disease than by a very rare\\ndisease. Table 20-2 presents an overview of possible causes of\\nFUO. Atypical presentations of endocarditis, diverticulitis, vertebral\\nosteomyelitis, and extrapulmonary tuberculosis are the more\\ncommon infectious disease diagnoses. Q fever and Whipple’s\\ndisease (Tropheryma whipplei infection) are quite rare but should\\nalways be kept in mind as a cause of FUO since the presenting\\nsymptoms can be nonspecific. Serologic testing for Q fever, which\\nresults from exposure to animals or animal products, should be\\nperformed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) when the patient\\nlives in a rural area or has a history of heart valve disease, an aortic\\naneurysm, or a vascular prosthesis. In patients with unexplained\\nsymptoms localized to the central nervous system, gastrointestinal\\ntract, or joints, polymerase chain reaction testing for Tropheryma\\nwhipplei should be performed. Travel to or (former) residence in\\ntropical countries or the American Southwest should lead to\\nconsideration of infectious diseases such as malaria, leishmaniasis,\\nhistoplasmosis, or coccidioidomycosis. Fever with signs of\\nendocarditis and negative blood culture results poses a special\\nproblem. Culture-negative endocarditis (Chap. 128) may be due to\\ndifficult-to-culture bacteria such as nutritionally variant bacteria,\\nHACEK organisms (including Haemophilus parainfluenzae, H.\\nparaphrophilus, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, A.\\naphrophilus, A. paraphrophilus, Cardiobacterium hominis, C.\\nvalvarum, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae; discussed\\nbelow), Coxiella burnetii, T. whipplei, and Bartonella species.\\nMarantic endocarditis is a sterile thrombotic disease that occurs as a\\nparaneoplastic phenomenon, especially with adenocarcinomas.'),\n",

The causes of syncope can be\\ndivided into three general categories: (1) neurally mediated syncope\\n(also called reflex or vasovagal syncope), (2) orthostatic\\nhypotension, and (3) cardiac syncope.\\nNeurally mediated syncope comprises a heterogeneous group of\\nfunctional disorders that are characterized by a transient change in\\nthe reflexes responsible for maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis.\\nEpisodic vasodilation (or loss of vasoconstrictor tone), decreased\\ncardiac output, and bradycardia occur in varying combinations,\\nresulting in temporary failure of blood pressure control.

The clinical\\nfeatures, underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, therapeutic\\ninterventions, and prognoses differ markedly among these three\\ncauses.\\n■ EPIDEMIOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY\\nSyncope is a common presenting problem, accounting for ∼ 3% of all\\nemergency department (ED) visits and 1% of all hospital admissions.\\nThe annual cost for syncope-related hospitalization in the United'),\n",

The bradyarrhythmias due to sinus\\nnode dysfunction are often associated with an atrial tachyarrhythmia,\\na disorder known as the tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome. A\\nprolonged pause following the termination of a tachycardic episode\\nis a frequent cause of syncope in patients with the tachycardia-\\nbradycardia syndrome. Medications of several classes may also\\ncause bradyarrhythmias of sufficient severity to cause syncope.\\nSyncope due to bradycardia or asystole has been referred to as a\\nStokes-Adams attack.\\nVentricular tachyarrhythmias frequently cause syncope. The\\nlikelihood of syncope with ventricular tachycardia is in part\\ndependent on the ventricular rate; rates <200 beats/min are less\\nlikely to cause syncope. The compromised hemodynamic function\\nduring ventricular tachycardia is caused by ineffective ventricular\\ncontraction, reduced diastolic filling due to abbreviated filling periods,\\nloss of AV synchrony, and concurrent myocardial ischemia.\\nSeveral disorders associated with cardiac electrophysiologic\\ninstability and arrhythmogenesis are due to mutations in ion channel\\nsubunit genes. These include the long QT syndrome, Brugada\\nsyndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular\\ntachycardia. The long QT syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous\\ndisorder associated with prolonged cardiac repolarization and a\\npredisposition to ventricular arrhythmias. Syncope and sudden death'),\n",

Walker, Robert B. Daroff\\nDizziness is an imprecise symptom used to describe a variety of\\ncommon sensations that include vertigo, light-headedness,\\nfaintness, and imbalance. Vertigo refers to a sense of spinning or\\nother motion that may be physiological, occurring during or after a\\nsustained head rotation, or pathological, due to vestibular\\ndysfunction. The term light-headedness is classically applied to\\npresyncopal sensations resulting from brain hypoperfusion but as\\nused by patients has little specificity, as it may also refer to other\\nsymptoms such as disequilibrium and imbalance. A challenge to\\ndiagnosis is that patients often have difficulty distinguishing among\\nthese various symptoms, and the words they choose do not reliably\\nindicate the underlying etiology.\\nThere are many causes of dizziness. Vestibular dizziness (vertigo\\nor imbalance) may be due to peripheral disorders that affect the\\nlabyrinths or vestibular nerves, or it may result from disruption of\\ncentral vestibular pathways. It may be paroxysmal or due to a fixed\\nunilateral or bilateral vestibular deficit. Acute unilateral lesions cause\\nvertigo due to a sudden imbalance in vestibular inputs from the two\\nlabyrinths. Bilateral lesions cause imbalance and instability of vision\\nwhen the head moves (oscillopsia) due to loss of normal vestibular\\nreflexes.\\nPresyncopal dizziness occurs when cardiac dysrhythmia,\\northostatic hypotension, medication effects, or another cause leads\\nto brain hypoperfusion. Such presyncopal sensations vary in\\nduration; they may increase in severity until loss of consciousness\\noccurs, or they may resolve before loss of consciousness if the\\ncerebral ischemia is corrected. Faintness and syncope, which are\\ndiscussed in detail in Chap. 21, should always be considered when\\none is evaluating patients with brief episodes of dizziness or\\ndizziness that occurs with upright posture.

Simply treating dizziness with vestibular suppressant\\nmedications is often not helpful and may make the symptoms worse\\nand prolong recovery. The diagnostic and specific treatment\\napproaches for the most commonly encountered vestibular disorders\\nare discussed below.\\n■ ACUTE PROLONGED VERTIGO (VESTIBULAR NEURITIS)\\nAn acute unilateral vestibular lesion causes constant vertigo,\\nnausea, vomiting, oscillopsia (motion of the visual scene), and\\nimbalance. These symptoms are due to a sudden asymmetry of\\ninputs from the two labyrinths or in their central connections,\\nsimulating a continuous rotation of the head. Unlike BPPV,\\ncontinuous vertigo persists even when the head remains still.\\nWhen a patient presents with an acute vestibular syndrome, the\\nmost important question is whether the lesion is central (e.g., a\\ncerebellar or brainstem infarct or hemorrhage), which may be life-\\nthreatening, or peripheral, affecting the vestibular nerve or labyrinth\\n(vestibular neuritis). Attention should be given to any symptoms or\\nsigns that point to central dysfunction (diplopia, weakness or\\nnumbness, dysarthria). The pattern of spontaneous nystagmus, if\\npresent, may be helpful (Table 22-1). If the head impulse test is\\nnormal, an acute peripheral vestibular lesion is unlikely. A central\\nlesion cannot always be excluded with certainty based on symptoms\\nand examination alone; thus older patients with vascular risk factors\\nwho present with an acute vestibular syndrome should be evaluated\\nfor the possibility of stroke even when there are no specific findings\\nthat indicate a central lesion.\\nMost patients with vestibular neuritis recover spontaneously,\\nalthough chronic dizziness, motion sensitivity, and disequilibrium\\nmay persist. The role of early glucocorticoid therapy is uncertain, as\\nstudies have yielded disparate results. Antiviral medications are of\\nno proven benefit and are not typically given unless there is\\nevidence to suggest herpes zoster oticus (Ramsay Hunt syndrome).\\nVestibular suppressant medications may reduce acute symptoms but\\nshould be avoided after the first several days because they may'),\n",

Episodes are brief\\n(<1 min and typically 15–20 s) and are always provoked by changes\\nin head position relative to gravity, such as lying down, rising from a\\nsupine position, and extending the head to look upward. Rolling over\\nin bed is a common trigger that may help to distinguish BPPV from\\northostatic hypotension. The attacks are caused by free-floating\\notoconia (calcium carbonate crystals) that have been dislodged from\\nthe utricular macula and have moved into one of the semicircular\\ncanals, usually the posterior canal. When head position changes,\\ngravity causes the otoconia to move within the canal, producing\\nvertigo and nystagmus. With posterior canal BPPV, the nystagmus\\nbeats upward and torsionally (the upper poles of the eyes beat\\ntoward the affected lower ear). Less commonly, the otoconia enter\\nthe horizontal canal, resulting in a horizontal nystagmus when the\\npatient is lying with either ear down. Superior (also called anterior)\\ncanal involvement is rare. BPPV is treated with repositioning\\nmaneuvers that use gravity to remove the otoconia from the\\nsemicircular canal. For posterior canal BPPV, the Epley maneuver\\n(Fig. 22-1) is the most commonly used procedure. For more\\nrefractory cases of BPPV, patients can be taught a variant of this\\nmaneuver that they can perform alone at home. A demonstration of\\nthe Epley maneuver is available online (http://www.dizziness-and-\\nbalance.com/disorders/bppv/bppv.html).'),\n",

Vertigo sometimes precedes a typical migraine\\nheadache but more often occurs without headache or with only a\\nmild headache. Some patients who have had frequent migraine\\nheadaches in the past present later in life with vestibular migraine as\\nthe predominant problem. In vestibular migraine, the duration of\\nvertigo may be from minutes to hours, and some migraineurs also\\nexperience more prolonged periods of disequilibrium (lasting days to\\nweeks). Motion sensitivity and sensitivity to visual motion (e.g.,\\nmovies) are common. Even in the absence of headache, other\\nmigraine features may be present, such as photophobia,'),\n",

Antiemetics may be helpful to relieve symptoms at the\\ntime of an attack.\\n■ MÉNIÈRE’S DISEASE\\nAttacks of Ménière’s disease consist of vertigo and hearing loss, as\\nwell as pain, pressure, and/or fullness in the affected ear. Low-\\nfrequency hearing loss and aural symptoms are key features that\\ndistinguish Ménière’s disease from other peripheral vestibulopathies\\nand from vestibular migraine. Audiometry at the time of an attack\\nshows a characteristic asymmetric low-frequency hearing loss;\\nhearing commonly improves between attacks, although permanent\\nhearing loss may eventually occur. Ménière’s disease is associated\\nwith excess endolymph fluid in the inner ear; hence the term\\nendolymphatic hydrops. The exact pathophysiological mechanism,\\nhowever, remains unclear. Patients suspected of having Ménière’s\\ndisease should be referred to an otolaryngologist for further\\nevaluation. Diuretics and sodium restriction are typically the initial\\ntreatments. If attacks persist, injections of glucocorticoids or\\ngentamicin into the middle ear may be considered. Nonablative\\nsurgical options include decompression and shunting of the\\nendolymphatic sac. Full ablative procedures (vestibular nerve\\nsection, labyrinthectomy) are seldom required.\\n■ VESTIBULAR SCHWANNOMA\\nVestibular schwannomas (sometimes termed acoustic neuromas)\\nand other tumors at the cerebellopontine angle cause slowly\\nprogressive unilateral sensorineural hearing loss and vestibular\\nhypofunction. These patients typically do not have vertigo, because\\nthe gradual vestibular deficit is compensated centrally as it develops.\\nThe diagnosis often is not made until there is sufficient hearing loss\\nto be noticed.

Bilateral\\nvestibular hypofunction may be (1) idiopathic and progressive, (2)\\npart of a neurodegenerative disorder, or (3) iatrogenic due to\\nmedication ototoxicity (most commonly gentamicin or other\\naminoglycoside antibiotics). Other causes include bilateral vestibular\\nschwannomas (neurofibromatosis type 2), autoimmune disease,\\nsuperficial siderosis, and meningeal-based infection or tumor.

Responses to caloric testing are reduced. Patients\\nwith bilateral vestibular hypofunction should be referred for vestibular\\nrehabilitation therapy.

Gelfand, Vanja C. Douglas\\nFatigue is one of the most common symptoms in clinical medicine. It\\nis a prominent manifestation of a number of systemic, neurologic,\\nand psychiatric syndromes, although a precise cause will not be\\nidentified in a substantial minority of patients. Fatigue refers to the\\nsubjective experience of physical and mental weariness,\\nsluggishness, low energy, and exhaustion. In the context of clinical\\nmedicine, fatigue is most practically defined as difficulty initiating or\\nmaintaining voluntary mental or physical activity. Nearly everyone\\nwho has ever been ill with a self-limited infection has experienced\\nthis near-universal symptom, and fatigue is usually brought to\\nmedical attention only when it is either of unclear cause, fails to\\nremit, or the severity is out of proportion with what would be\\nexpected for the associated trigger.\\nFatigue should be distinguished from muscle weakness, a\\nreduction of neuromuscular power (Chap. 24); most patients\\ncomplaining of fatigue are not truly weak when direct muscle power\\nis tested. Fatigue is also distinct from somnolence, which refers to\\nsleepiness in the context of disturbed sleep-wake physiology (Chap.\\n31), and from dyspnea on exertion, although patients may use the\\nword fatigue to describe any of these symptoms. The task facing\\nclinicians when a patient presents with fatigue is to identify the\\nunderlying cause and develop a therapeutic alliance, the goal of\\nwhich is to spare patients expensive and fruitless diagnostic workups\\nand steer them toward effective therapy.\\n■ EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS\\nVariability in the definitions of fatigue and the survey instruments\\nused in different studies makes it difficult to arrive at precise figures\\nabout the global burden of fatigue.

By contrast, the prevalence of chronic fatigue\\nsyndrome (Chap. 450), as defined by the U.S. Centers for Disease\\nControl and Prevention, is low.\\n■ DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nPsychiatric Disease Fatigue is a common somatic manifestation of\\nmany major psychiatric syndromes, including depression, anxiety,\\nand somatoform disorders (Chap. 452). Psychiatric symptoms are\\nreported in more than three-quarters of patients with unexplained\\nchronic fatigue. Even in patients with systemic or neurologic\\ndisorders in which fatigue is independently recognized as a\\nsymptom, comorbid psychiatric disease may still be an important\\ncontributor.\\nFatigue Patients complaining of fatigue often say they feel weak, but\\nupon careful examination, objective muscle weakness is rarely\\ndiscernible.

Fatigability of muscle power is a cardinal manifestation\\nof some neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis and is\\ndistinguished from fatigue by finding clinically evident diminution of\\nthe amount of force that a muscle generates upon repeated\\ncontraction (Chap. 448). Fatigue is one of the most common and\\nbothersome symptoms reported in multiple sclerosis (MS) (Chap.\\n444), affecting nearly 90% of patients; fatigue in MS can persist\\nbetween MS attacks and does not necessarily correlate with\\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disease activity.

Motor system dysfunction leads\\nto weakness or paralysis, discussed in this chapter, or to ataxia\\n(Chap. 439) or abnormal movements (Chap. 436). Weakness is a\\nreduction in the power that can be exerted by one or more muscles.\\nIt must be distinguished from increased fatigability (i.e., the inability\\nto sustain the performance of an activity that should be normal for a\\nperson of the same age, sex, and size), limitation in function due to\\npain or articular stiffness, or impaired motor activity because severe\\nproprioceptive sensory loss prevents adequate feedback information\\nabout the direction and power of movements. It is also distinct from\\nbradykinesia (in which increased time is required for full power to be\\nexerted) and apraxia, a disorder of planning and initiating a skilled or\\nlearned movement unrelated to a significant motor or sensory deficit\\n(Chap. 30).\\nParalysis or the suffix “-plegia” indicates weakness so severe that\\na muscle cannot be contracted at all, whereas paresis refers to less\\nsevere weakness. The prefix “hemi-” refers to one-half of the body,\\n“para-” to both legs, and “quadri-” to all four limbs.\\nThe distribution of weakness helps to localize the underlying\\nlesion. Weakness from involvement of upper motor neurons occurs\\nparticularly in the extensors and abductors of the upper limb and the\\nflexors of the lower limb. Lower motor neuron weakness depends on\\nwhether involvement is at the level of the anterior horn cells, nerve\\nroot, limb plexus, or peripheral nerve—only muscles supplied by the\\naffected structure are weak.

Weakness leads to delayed or\\nreduced recruitment of motor units, with fewer than normal activated\\nat a particular discharge frequency.\\nNeuromuscular Junction Weakness Disorders of the\\nneuromuscular junction produce weakness of variable degree and\\ndistribution. The number of muscle fibers that are activated varies\\nover time, depending on the state of rest of the neuromuscular\\njunctions. Strength is influenced by preceding activity of the affected\\nmuscle. In myasthenia gravis, for example, sustained or repeated\\ncontractions of affected muscle decline in strength despite continuing\\neffort (Chap. 440). Thus, fatigable weakness is suggestive of\\ndisorders of the neuromuscular junction, which cause functional loss\\nof muscle fibers due to failure of their activation.\\nMyopathic Weakness Myopathic weakness is produced by a\\ndecrease in the number or contractile force of muscle fibers\\nactivated within motor units. With muscular dystrophies,\\ninflammatory myopathies, or myopathies with muscle fiber necrosis,\\nthe number of muscle fibers is reduced within many motor units. On\\nEMG, the size of each motor unit action potential is decreased, and\\nmotor units must be recruited more rapidly than normal to produce\\nthe desired power. Some myopathies produce weakness through\\nloss of contractile force of muscle fibers or through relatively\\nselective involvement of type II (fast) fibers. These myopathies may\\nnot affect the size of individual motor unit action potentials and are\\ndetected by a discrepancy between the electrical activity and force of\\na muscle.\\nPsychogenic Weakness Weakness may occur without a\\nrecognizable organic basis. It tends to be variable, inconsistent, and\\nwith a pattern of distribution that cannot be explained on a'),\n",

The presence of other neurologic\\ndeficits helps localize the lesion. Thus language disorders, for\\nexample, point to a cortical lesion. Homonymous visual field defects\\nreflect either a cortical or a subcortical hemispheric lesion. A “pure\\nmotor” hemiparesis of the face, arm, and leg often is due to a small,\\ndiscrete lesion in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, cerebral\\npeduncle in the midbrain, or upper pons. Some brainstem lesions\\nproduce “crossed paralyses,” consisting of ipsilateral cranial nerve\\nsigns and contralateral hemiparesis (Chap. 426). The absence of\\ncranial nerve signs or facial weakness suggests that a hemiparesis\\nis due to a lesion in the high cervical spinal cord, especially if\\nassociated with Brown-Séquard syndrome, consisting of loss of joint\\nposition and vibration sense on the side of the weakness, and loss of\\npain and temperature sense on the opposite side (Chap. 442).\\nAcute or episodic hemiparesis usually results from focal\\nstructural lesions, particularly vascular etiologies, rapidly expanding\\nlesions, or an inflammatory process. Subacute hemiparesis that\\nevolves over days or weeks may relate to subdural hematoma,\\ninfectious or inflammatory disorders (e.g., cerebral abscess, fungal\\ngranuloma or meningitis, parasitic infection, multiple sclerosis,\\nsarcoidosis), or primary or metastatic neoplasms. AIDS may present\\nwith subacute hemiparesis due to toxoplasmosis or primary central\\nnervous system (CNS) lymphoma. Chronic hemiparesis that evolves\\nover months usually is due to a neoplasm or vascular malformation,\\na chronic subdural hematoma, or a degenerative disease.\\nInvestigation of hemiparesis (Fig. 24-3) of acute origin usually\\nstarts with a CT scan of the brain and laboratory studies.

Hauser\\nNormal somatic sensation reflects a continuous monitoring process,\\nlittle of which reaches consciousness under ordinary conditions.

Physicians\\nshould be able to recognize abnormal sensations by how they are\\ndescribed, know their type and likely site of origin, and understand\\ntheir implications. Pain is considered separately in Chap. 13.\\n■ POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS\\nAbnormal sensory symptoms can be divided into two categories:\\npositive and negative. The prototypical positive symptom is tingling\\n(pins and needles); other positive sensory phenomena include itch\\nand altered sensations that are described as pricking, bandlike,\\nlightning-like shooting feelings (lancinations), aching, knifelike,\\ntwisting, drawing, pulling, tightening, burning, searing, electrical, or\\nraw feelings. Such symptoms are often painful.\\nPositive phenomena usually result from trains of impulses\\ngenerated at sites of lowered threshold or heightened excitability\\nalong a peripheral or central sensory pathway. The nature and\\nseverity of the abnormal sensation depend on the number, rate,\\ntiming, and distribution of ectopic impulses and the type and function\\nof nervous tissue in which they arise. Because positive phenomena\\nrepresent excessive activity in sensory pathways, they are not\\nnecessarily associated with a sensory deficit (loss) on examination.\\nNegative phenomena represent loss of sensory function and are\\ncharacterized by diminished or absent feeling that often is\\nexperienced as numbness and by abnormal findings on sensory\\nexamination.

The term paresthesias typically refers to\\ntingling or pins-and-needles sensations but may include a wide\\nvariety of other abnormal sensations, except pain; it sometimes\\nimplies that the abnormal sensations are perceived spontaneously.\\nThe more general term dysesthesias denotes all types of abnormal\\nsensations, including painful ones, regardless of whether a stimulus\\nis evident.\\nAnother set of terms refers to sensory abnormalities found on\\nexamination. Hypesthesia or hypoesthesia refers to a reduction of\\ncutaneous sensation to a specific type of testing such as pressure,\\nlight touch, and warm or cold stimuli; anesthesia, to a complete\\nabsence of skin sensation to the same stimuli plus pinprick; and\\nhypalgesia or analgesia, to reduced or absent pain perception\\n(nociception). Hyperesthesia means pain or increased sensitivity in\\nresponse to touch. Similarly, allodynia describes the situation in\\nwhich a nonpainful stimulus, once perceived, is experienced as\\npainful, even excruciating. An example is elicitation of a painful\\nsensation by application of a vibrating tuning fork. Hyperalgesia\\ndenotes severe pain in response to a mildly noxious stimulus, and\\nhyperpathia, a broad term, encompasses all the phenomena\\ndescribed by hyperesthesia, allodynia, and hyperalgesia. With\\nhyperpathia, the threshold for a sensory stimulus is increased and\\nperception is delayed, but once felt, it is unduly painful.\\nDisorders of deep sensation arising from muscle spindles,\\ntendons, and joints affect proprioception (position sense).'),\n",

Baker\\nPREVALENCE, MORBIDITY, AND MORTALITY\\nGait and balance problems are common in the elderly and contribute\\nto the risk of falls and injury. Gait disorders have been described in\\n15% of individuals aged >65. By age 80, one person in four will use\\na mechanical aid to assist with ambulation. Among those aged ≥85,\\nthe prevalence of gait abnormality approaches 40%. In\\nepidemiologic studies, gait disorders are consistently identified as a\\nmajor risk factor for falls and injury.\\nANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY\\nAn upright bipedal gait depends on the successful integration of\\npostural control and locomotion. These functions are widely\\ndistributed in the central nervous system. The biomechanics of\\nbipedal walking are complex, and the performance is easily\\ncompromised by a neurologic deficit at any level. Command and\\ncontrol centers in the brainstem, cerebellum, and forebrain modify\\nthe action of spinal pattern generators to promote stepping. While a\\nform of “fictive locomotion” can be elicited from quadrupedal animals\\nafter spinal transection, this capacity is limited in primates. Step\\ngeneration in primates is dependent on locomotor centers in the\\npontine tegmentum, midbrain, and subthalamic region. Locomotor\\nsynergies are executed through the reticular formation and\\ndescending pathways in the ventromedial spinal cord. Cerebral\\ncontrol provides a goal and purpose for walking and is involved in\\navoidance of obstacles and adaptation of locomotor programs to\\ncontext and terrain.\\nPostural control requires the maintenance of the center of mass\\nover the base of support through the gait cycle.

Forward motion of the center of\\nmass provides propulsive force for stepping, but failure to maintain\\nthe center of mass within stability limits results in falls. The anatomic\\nsubstrate for dynamic balance has not been well defined, but the\\nvestibular nucleus and midline cerebellum contribute to balance\\ncontrol in animals. Patients with damage to these structures have\\nimpaired balance while standing and walking.\\nStanding balance depends on good-quality sensory information\\nabout the position of the body center with respect to the\\nenvironment, support surface, and gravitational forces. Sensory\\ninformation for postural control is primarily generated by the visual\\nsystem, the vestibular system, and proprioceptive receptors in the\\nmuscle spindles and joints. A healthy redundancy of sensory afferent\\ninformation is generally available, but loss of two of the three\\npathways is sufficient to compromise standing balance. Balance\\ndisorders in older individuals sometimes result from multiple insults\\nin the peripheral sensory systems (e.g., visual loss, vestibular deficit,\\nperipheral neuropathy) that critically degrade the quality of afferent\\ninformation needed for balance stability.\\nOlder patients with cognitive impairment appear to be particularly\\nprone to falls and injury. There is a growing body of literature on the\\nuse of attentional resources to manage gait and balance. Walking is\\ngenerally considered to be unconscious and automatic, but the\\nability to walk while attending to a cognitive task (dual-task walking)\\nmay be compromised in the elderly. Older patients with deficits in\\nexecutive function may have particular difficulty in managing the\\nattentional resources needed for dynamic balance when distracted.\\nDISORDERS OF GAIT\\nDisorders of gait may be attributed to neurologic and nonneurologic\\ncauses, although significant overlap often exists.

Andrew Josephson, Bruce L. Miller\\nConfusion, a mental and behavioral state of reduced\\ncomprehension, coherence, and capacity to reason, is one of the\\nmost common problems encountered in medicine, accounting for a\\nlarge number of emergency department visits, hospital admissions,\\nand inpatient consultations. Delirium, a term used to describe an\\nacute confusional state, remains a major cause of morbidity and\\nmortality, costing billions of dollars yearly in health care costs in the\\nUnited States alone. Despite increased efforts targeting awareness\\nof this condition, delirium often goes unrecognized in the face of\\nevidence that it is usually the cognitive manifestation of serious\\nunderlying medical or neurologic illness.\\n■ CLINICAL FEATURES OF DELIRIUM\\nA multitude of terms are used to describe patients with delirium,\\nincluding encephalopathy, acute brain failure, acute confusional\\nstate, and postoperative or intensive care unit (ICU) psychosis.\\nDelirium has many clinical manifestations, but it is defined as a\\nrelatively acute decline in cognition that fluctuates over hours or\\ndays. The hallmark of delirium is a deficit of attention, although all\\ncognitive domains—including memory, executive function,\\nvisuospatial tasks, and language—are variably involved. Associated\\nsymptoms that may be present in some cases include altered sleep-\\nwake cycles, perceptual disturbances such as hallucinations or\\ndelusions, affect changes, and autonomic findings that include heart\\nrate and blood pressure instability.\\nDelirium is a clinical diagnosis that is made only at the bedside.\\nTwo subtypes have been described—hyperactive and hypoactive—\\nbased on differential psychomotor features. The cognitive syndrome\\nassociated with severe alcohol withdrawal (i.e., “delirium tremens”)\\nremains the classic example of the hyperactive subtype, featuring\\nprominent hallucinations, agitation, and hyperarousal, often'),\n",

In striking\\ncontrast is the hypoactive subtype, exemplified by benzodiazepine\\nintoxication, in which patients are withdrawn and quiet, with\\nprominent apathy and psychomotor slowing.\\nThis dichotomy between subtypes of delirium is a useful\\nconstruct, but patients often fall somewhere along a spectrum\\nbetween the hyperactive and hypoactive extremes, sometimes\\nfluctuating from one to the other. Therefore, clinicians must\\nrecognize this broad range of presentations of delirium to identify all\\npatients with this potentially reversible cognitive disturbance.\\nHyperactive patients are often easily recognized by their\\ncharacteristic severe agitation, tremor, hallucinations, and autonomic\\ninstability. Patients who are quietly hypoactive are more often\\noverlooked on the medical wards and in the ICU.\\nThe reversibility of delirium is emphasized because many\\netiologies, such as infection and medication effects, can be treated\\neasily. The long-term cognitive consequences of delirium remain an\\narea of active research. Some episodes of delirium continue for\\nweeks, months, or even years. The persistence of delirium in some\\npatients and its high recurrence rate may be due to inadequate initial\\ntreatment of the underlying etiology. In other instances, delirium\\nappears to cause permanent neuronal damage and long-term\\ncognitive decline. Therefore, prevention strategies are important to\\nimplement. Even if an episode of delirium completely resolves, there\\nmay be lingering effects of the disorder; a patient’s recall of events\\nafter delirium varies widely, ranging from complete amnesia to\\nrepeated reexperiencing of the frightening period of confusion,\\nsimilar to what is seen in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder.\\n■ RISK FACTORS\\nAn effective primary prevention strategy for delirium begins with\\nidentification of high-risk patients.

Dementia is defined as an acquired\\ndeterioration in cognitive abilities that impairs the successful\\nperformance of activities of daily living. Episodic memory, the ability\\nto recall events specific in time and place, is the cognitive function\\nmost commonly lost; 10% of persons age >70 years and 20–40% of\\nindividuals age >85 years have clinically identifiable memory loss. In\\naddition to memory, dementia may erode other mental faculties,\\nincluding language, visuospatial, praxis, calculation, judgment, and\\nproblem-solving abilities. Neuropsychiatric and social deficits also\\narise in many dementia syndromes, manifesting as depression,\\napathy, anxiety, hallucinations, delusions, agitation, insomnia, sleep\\ndisturbances, compulsions, or disinhibition. The clinical course may\\nbe slowly progressive, as in Alzheimer’s disease (AD); static, as in\\nanoxic encephalopathy; or may fluctuate from day to day or minute\\nto minute, as in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Most patients with\\nAD, the most prevalent form of dementia, begin with episodic\\nmemory impairment, but in other dementias, such as frontotemporal\\ndementia (FTD), memory loss is not typically a presenting feature.\\nFocal cerebral disorders are discussed in Chap. 30 and\\nillustrated in a video library in Chap.

The\\nprevalence of disabling memory loss increases with each decade\\nover age 50 and is usually associated with the microscopic changes\\nof AD at autopsy. Yet some centenarians have intact memory\\nfunction and no evidence of clinically significant dementia. Whether\\ndementia is an inevitable consequence of normal human aging\\nremains controversial although the prevalence increases with every\\ndecade of life.\\nThe many causes of dementia are listed in Table 29-1. The\\nfrequency of each condition depends on the age group under study,\\naccess of the group to medical care, country of origin, and perhaps\\nracial or ethnic background. AD is the most common cause of\\ndementia in Western countries, accounting for more than half of all\\npatients. Vascular disease is the second most frequent cause for\\ndementia and is particularly common in elderly patients or\\npopulations with limited access to medical care, where vascular risk\\nfactors are undertreated. Often, vascular brain injury is mixed with\\nneurodegenerative disorders, particularly AD, making it difficult, even\\nfor the neuropathologist, to estimate the contribution of\\ncerebrovascular disease to the cognitive disorder in an individual\\npatient. Dementias associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) are\\ncommon and may develop years after onset of a parkinsonian\\ndisorder, as seen with PD-related dementia (PDD), or they can occur\\nconcurrently with or preceding the motor syndrome, as in DLB.\\nLimbic-predominant aging-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) is\\ncommon after age 70 and has been linked to declining episodic\\nmemory function. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a unique\\ndisease found in individuals with a history of repetitive head impacts\\n(e.g., professional athletes in collision or fighting sports, military\\nveterans exposed to multiple blasts), presents with changes in\\ncognition, mood, behavior, or motor function.

The primary sensory and motor areas\\nconstitute 10% of the cerebral cortex. The rest is subsumed by\\nmodality-selective, heteromodal, paralimbic, and limbic areas\\ncollectively known as the association cortex (Fig. 30-1). The\\nassociation cortex mediates the integrative processes that subserve\\ncognition, emotion, and comportment. A systematic testing of these\\nmental functions is necessary for the effective clinical assessment of\\nthe association cortex and its diseases. According to current\\nthinking, there are no centers for “hearing words,” “perceiving\\nspace,” or “storing memories.” Cognitive and behavioral functions\\n(domains) are coordinated by intersecting large-scale neural\\nnetworks that contain interconnected cortical and subcortical\\ncomponents. Five anatomically defined large-scale networks are\\nmost relevant to clinical practice: (1) a left-dominant perisylvian\\nnetwork for language, (2) a right-dominant parietofrontal network for\\nspatial orientation, (3) an occipitotemporal network for face and\\nobject recognition, (4) a limbic network for episodic memory and\\nemotional modulation, and (5) a prefrontal network for the executive\\ncontrol of cognition and comportment.

A deficit of naming (anomia) is the single most common\\nfinding in aphasic patients. When asked to name a common object,\\nthe patient may fail to come up with the appropriate word, may\\nprovide a circumlocutious description of the object (“the thing for\\nwriting”), or may come up with the wrong word (paraphasia). If the\\npatient offers an incorrect but related word (“pen” for “pencil”), the\\nnaming error is known as a semantic paraphasia; if the word\\napproximates the correct answer but is phonetically inaccurate\\n(“plentil” for “pencil”), it is known as a phonemic paraphasia. In most\\nanomias, the patient cannot retrieve the appropriate name when\\nshown an object but can point to the appropriate object when the\\nname is provided by the examiner. This is known as a one-way (or\\nretrieval-based) naming deficit. A two-way (comprehension-based or\\nsemantic) naming deficit exists if the patient can neither provide nor\\nrecognize the correct name. Spontaneous speech is described as\\n“fluent” if it maintains appropriate output volume, phrase length, and\\nmelody or as “nonfluent” if it is sparse and halting and average\\nutterance length is below four words. The examiner also should note\\nthe integrity of grammar as manifested by word order (syntax),\\ntenses, suffixes, prefixes, plurals, and possessives. Comprehension\\ncan be tested by assessing the patient’s ability to follow\\nconversation, asking yes-no questions (“Can a dog fly?” “Does it\\nsnow in summer?”), asking the patient to point to appropriate objects\\n(“Where is the source of illumination in this room?”), or asking for\\nverbal definitions of single words. Repetition is assessed by asking\\nthe patient to repeat single words, short sentences, or strings of\\nwords such as “No ifs, ands, or buts.” The testing of repetition with\\ntongue twisters such as “hippopotamus” and “Irish constabulary”\\nprovides a better assessment of dysarthria and apraxia of speech'),\n",

According to one model of spatial\\ncognition, the right hemisphere directs attention within the entire\\nextrapersonal space, whereas the left hemisphere directs attention\\nmostly within the contralateral right hemispace. Consequently, left\\nhemisphere lesions do not give rise to much contralesional neglect\\nbecause the global attentional mechanisms of the right hemisphere\\ncan compensate for the loss of the contralaterally directed attentional\\nfunctions of the left hemisphere. Right hemisphere lesions, however,\\ngive rise to severe contralesional left hemispatial neglect because\\nthe unaffected left hemisphere does not contain ipsilateral attentional\\nmechanisms. This model is consistent with clinical experience, which\\nshows that contralesional neglect is more common, more severe,\\nand longer lasting after damage to the right hemisphere than after\\ndamage to the left hemisphere. Severe neglect for the right\\nhemispace is rare, even in left-handers with left hemisphere lesions.\\nClinical Examination Patients with severe neglect may fail to dress,\\nshave, or groom the left side of the body; fail to eat food placed on\\nthe left side of the tray; and fail to read the left half of sentences.\\nWhen asked to copy a simple line drawing, the patient fails to copy\\ndetail on the left, and when the patient is asked to write, there is a\\ntendency to leave an unusually wide margin on the left. Two bedside\\ntests that are useful in assessing neglect are simultaneous bilateral\\nstimulation and visual target cancellation. In the former, the examiner\\nprovides either unilateral or simultaneous bilateral stimulation in the\\nvisual, auditory, and tactile modalities. After right hemisphere injury,\\npatients who have no difficulty detecting unilateral stimuli on either\\nside experience the bilaterally presented stimulus as coming only\\nfrom the right.

A patient with simultanagnosia “misses the forest\\nfor the trees.” For example, a patient who is shown a table lamp and\\nasked to name the object may look at its circular base and call it an\\nashtray. Some patients with simultanagnosia report that objects they\\nlook at may vanish suddenly, probably indicating an inability to\\ncompute the oculomotor return to the original point of gaze after brief\\nsaccadic displacements. Movement and distracting stimuli greatly\\nexacerbate the difficulties of visual perception. Simultanagnosia can\\noccur without the other two components of Bálint’s syndrome,\\nespecially in association with AD.\\nA modification of the letter cancellation task described above can\\nbe used for the bedside diagnosis of simultanagnosia. In this\\nmodification, some of the targets (e.g., A’s) are made to be much\\nlarger than the others (7.5–10 cm vs 2.5 cm [3–4 in. vs 1 in.] in\\nheight), and all targets are embedded among foils. Patients with\\nsimultanagnosia display a counterintuitive but characteristic\\ntendency to miss the larger targets (Fig. 30-3B ).

The average adult needs 7.5–8 h of sleep, but\\non weeknights the average U.S. adult gets only 6.75 h of sleep. Only\\n30% of the U.S. adult population reports consistently obtaining\\nsufficient sleep. Insufficient sleep is especially common among shift\\nworkers, individuals working multiple jobs, and people in lower\\nsocioeconomic groups. Most teenagers need ≥9 h of sleep, but\\nmany fail to get enough sleep because of circadian phase delay, plus\\nsocial pressures to stay up late coupled with early school start times.\\nLate evening light exposure, television viewing, video-gaming, social\\nmedia, texting, and smartphone use often delay bedtimes, despite\\nthe fixed early wake times required for work or school. As is typical\\nwith any disorder that causes sleepiness, individuals with chronically\\ninsufficient sleep may feel inattentive, irritable, unmotivated, and\\ndepressed, and have difficulty with school, work, and driving.\\nIndividuals differ in their optimal amount of sleep, and it can be\\nhelpful to ask how much sleep the patient obtains on a quiet vacation\\nwhen he or she can sleep without restrictions. Some patients may\\nthink that a short amount of sleep is normal or advantageous, and\\nthey may not appreciate their biological need for more sleep,\\nespecially if coffee and other stimulants mask the sleepiness. A 2-\\nweek sleep log documenting the timing of sleep and daily level of\\nalertness is diagnostically useful and provides helpful feedback for\\nthe patient. Extending sleep to the optimal amount on a regular basis\\ncan resolve the sleepiness and other symptoms. As with any lifestyle\\nchange, extending sleep requires commitment and adjustments, but\\nthe improvements in daytime alertness make this change worthwhile.'),\n",

At least 24% of middle-aged men and 9% of middle-aged\\nwomen in the United States have a reduction or cessation of\\nbreathing dozens or more times each night during sleep, with 9% of\\nmen and 4% of women doing so more than a hundred times per\\nnight. These episodes may be due to an occlusion of the airway\\n(obstructive sleep apnea), absence of respiratory effort (central sleep\\napnea), or a combination of these factors. Failure to recognize and\\ntreat these conditions appropriately may reduce daytime alertness\\nand increase the risk of sleep-related motor vehicle crashes,\\ndepression, hypertension, myocardial infarction, diabetes, stroke,\\nand mortality. Sleep apnea is particularly prevalent in overweight\\nmen and in the elderly, yet it is estimated to go undiagnosed in most\\naffected individuals. This is unfortunate because several effective\\ntreatments are available. Readers are referred to Chap. 297 for a\\ncomprehensive review of the diagnosis and treatment of\\npatients with sleep apnea.\\n■ NARCOLEPSY\\nNarcolepsy is characterized by difficulty sustaining wakefulness,\\npoor regulation of REM sleep, and disturbed nocturnal sleep. All\\npatients with narcolepsy have excessive daytime sleepiness. This\\nsleepiness is usually moderate to severe, and in contrast to patients\\nwith disrupted sleep (e.g., sleep apnea), people with narcolepsy\\nusually feel well rested upon awakening and then feel tired\\nthroughout much of the day. They may fall asleep at inappropriate\\ntimes, but then feel refreshed again after a nap. In addition, they\\noften experience symptoms related to an intrusion of REM sleep\\ncharacteristics into wakefulness. REM sleep is characterized by\\ndreaming and muscle paralysis, and people with narcolepsy can\\nhave: (1) sudden muscle weakness without a loss of consciousness,\\nwhich is usually triggered by strong emotions (cataplexy; Video 31-\\n1); (2) dream-like hallucinations at sleep onset (hypnagogic\\nhallucinations) or upon awakening (hypnopompic hallucinations);\\nand (3) muscle paralysis upon awakening (sleep paralysis).

For most\\npatients with RLS, these dysesthesias and restlessness are much\\nworse in the evening and first half of the night. The symptoms\\nappear with inactivity and can make sitting still in an airplane or\\nwhen watching a movie a miserable experience. The sensations are\\ntemporarily relieved by movement, stretching, or massage. This\\nnocturnal discomfort usually interferes with sleep, and patients may\\nreport daytime sleepiness as a consequence. RLS is very common,\\naffecting 5–10% of adults, and is more common in women and older\\nadults.\\nA variety of factors can cause RLS. Iron deficiency is the most\\ncommon treatable cause, and iron replacement should be\\nconsidered if the ferritin level is <75 ng/mL. RLS can also occur with\\nperipheral neuropathies and uremia and can be worsened by\\npregnancy, caffeine, alcohol, antidepressants, lithium, neuroleptics,\\nand antihistamines.

Horton\\nTHE HUMAN VISUAL SYSTEM\\nThe visual system provides a supremely efficient means for the rapid\\nassimilation of information from the environment to aid in the\\nguidance of behavior. The act of seeing begins with the capture of\\nimages focused by the cornea and lens on a light-sensitive\\nmembrane in the back of the eye called the retina. The retina is\\nactually part of the brain, banished to the periphery to serve as a\\ntransducer for the conversion of patterns of light energy into\\nneuronal signals. Light is absorbed by pigment in two types of\\nphotoreceptors: rods and cones. In the human retina, there are 100\\nmillion rods and 5 million cones. The rods operate in dim (scotopic)\\nillumination. The cones function under daylight (photopic) conditions.\\nThe cone system is specialized for color perception and high spatial\\nresolution. The majority of cones are within the macula, the portion\\nof the retina that serves the central 10° of vision. In the middle of the\\nmacula, a small pit termed the fovea, packed exclusively with cones,\\nprovides the best visual acuity.\\nPhotoreceptors hyperpolarize in response to light, activating\\nbipolar, amacrine, and horizontal cells in the inner nuclear layer.\\nAfter processing of photoreceptor responses by this complex retinal\\ncircuit, the flow of sensory information ultimately converges on a final\\ncommon pathway: the ganglion cells. These cells translate the visual\\nimage impinging on the retina into a continuously varying barrage of\\naction potentials that propagates along the primary optic pathway to\\nvisual centers within the brain. There are a million ganglion cells in\\neach retina and hence a million fibers in each optic nerve.\\nGanglion cell axons sweep along the inner surface of the retina in\\nthe nerve fiber layer, exit the eye at the optic disc, and travel through\\nthe optic nerve, optic chiasm, and optic tract to reach targets in the\\nbrain. The majority of fibers synapse on cells in the lateral geniculate'),\n",

If the retina or optic nerve is only partially\\ninjured, the direct pupillary response will be weaker than the\\nconsensual pupillary response evoked by shining a light into the\\nhealthy fellow eye. A relative afferent pupillary defect (Marcus Gunn\\npupil) is elicited with the swinging flashlight test (Fig. 32-2). It is an\\nextremely useful sign in retrobulbar optic neuritis and other optic\\nnerve diseases, in which it may be the sole objective evidence for\\ndisease.

Pineal region or midbrain\\ntumors, cysticercosis, and stroke also cause Parinaud’s syndrome.\\nFeatures include loss of upgaze (and sometimes downgaze),\\nconvergence-retraction nystagmus on attempted upgaze, downward\\nocular deviation (“setting sun” sign), lid retraction (Collier’s sign),\\nskew deviation, pseudoabducens palsy, and light-near dissociation\\nof the pupils.\\nNystagmus This is a rhythmic oscillation of the eyes, occurring\\nphysiologically from vestibular and optokinetic stimulation or\\npathologically in a wide variety of diseases (Chap. 22).\\nAbnormalities of the eyes or optic nerves, present at birth or\\nacquired in childhood, can produce a complex, searching nystagmus\\nwith irregular pendular (sinusoidal) and jerk features. Examples are\\nalbinism, Leber’s congenital amaurosis, and bilateral cataract. This\\nnystagmus is commonly referred to as congenital sensory\\nnystagmus. This is a poor term because even in children with\\ncongenital lesions, the nystagmus does not appear until weeks after\\nbirth. Congenital motor nystagmus, which looks similar to congenital\\nsensory nystagmus, develops in the absence of any abnormality of\\nthe sensory visual system. Visual acuity also is reduced in congenital\\nmotor nystagmus, probably by the nystagmus itself, but seldom\\nbelow a level of 20/200.\\nJERK NYSTAGMUS This is characterized by a slow drift off the target,\\nfollowed by a fast corrective saccade. By convention, the nystagmus\\nis named after the quick phase. Jerk nystagmus can be downbeat,\\nupbeat, horizontal (left or right), and torsional. The pattern of\\nnystagmus may vary with gaze position. Some patients will be\\noblivious to their nystagmus. Others will complain of blurred vision or\\na subjective to-and-fro movement of the environment (oscillopsia)\\ncorresponding to the nystagmus. Fine nystagmus may be difficult to\\nsee on gross examination of the eyes. Observation of nystagmoid'),\n",

Peripheral vestibular nystagmus\\noften occurs in discrete attacks, with symptoms of nausea and\\nvertigo. There may be associated tinnitus and hearing loss.

Doty, Steven M. Bromley\\nAll environmental chemicals necessary for life enter the body by the\\nnose and mouth. The senses of smell (olfaction) and taste\\n(gustation) monitor such chemicals, determine the flavor and\\npalatability of foods and beverages, and warn of dangerous\\nenvironmental conditions, including fire, air pollution, leaking natural\\ngas, and bacteria-laden foodstuffs. These senses contribute\\nsignificantly to quality of life and, when dysfunctional, can have\\nuntoward physical and psychological consequences. A longitudinal\\nstudy of 1162 nondemented elderly persons found, even after\\ncontrolling for confounders, that those with the lowest baseline\\nolfactory test scores had a 45% mortality rate over a 4-year period,\\ncompared to an 18% mortality rate for those with the highest\\nolfactory test scores. A basic understanding of these senses in\\nhealth and disease is critical for the physician, because thousands of\\npatients present to doctors’ offices each year with complaints of\\nchemosensory dysfunction. Among the more important recent\\ndevelopments in neurology is the discovery that decreased smell\\nfunction is among the first signs of such neurodegenerative diseases\\nas Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD),\\nsignifying their “presymptomatic” phase.\\n■ ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY\\nOlfactory System Odorous chemicals enter the front of nose during\\ninhalation and active sniffing, as well as the back of the nose\\n(nasopharynx) during deglutition.

This 21st edition is a true landmark in\\nmedicine, spanning 71 years and multiple generations of trainees\\nand practicing clinicians. While medicine and medical education\\nhave evolved, readers will appreciate how this classic textbook has\\nretained enduring features that have distinguished it among medical\\ntexts—a sharp focus on the clinical presentation of disease, expert\\nin-depth summaries of pathophysiology and treatment, and\\nhighlights of emerging frontiers of science and medicine. Indeed,\\nHarrison’s retains its conviction that, in the profession of medicine,\\nwe are all perpetual students with lifelong learning as our common\\ngoal.\\nHarrison’s is intended for learners throughout their careers. For\\nstudents, Part 1, Chapter 1 begins with an overview of “The Practice\\nof Medicine.” In this introductory chapter, the editors continue the\\ntradition of orienting clinicians to the science and the art of medicine,\\nemphasizing the values of our profession while incorporating new\\nadvances in technology, science, and clinical care. Part 2, “Cardinal\\nManifestations and Presentation of Diseases,” is a signature feature\\nof Harrison’s. These chapters eloquently describe how patients\\npresent with common clinical conditions, such as headache, fever,\\ncough, palpitations, or anemia, and provide an overview of typical\\nsymptoms, physical findings, and differential diagnosis. Mastery of\\nthese topics prepares students for subsequent chapters on specific\\ndiseases they will encounter in courses on pathophysiology and in\\nclinical clerkships. For residents and fellows caring for patients and\\npreparing for board examinations, Harrison’s remains a definitive\\nsource of trusted content written by internationally renowned experts.\\nTrainees will be reassured by the depth of content, comprehensive\\ntables, and illuminating figures and clinical algorithms. Many\\nexamination questions are based on key testing points derived from\\nHarrison’s chapters. A useful companion book, Harrison’s Self-'),\n",

Recent\\nevents should be given the most attention. Patients should, at some\\nearly point, have the opportunity to tell their own story of the illness\\nwithout frequent interruption and, when appropriate, should receive\\nexpressions of interest, encouragement, and empathy from the\\nphysician. Any event related by a patient, however trivial or\\nseemingly irrelevant, may provide the key to solving the medical\\nproblem. A methodical review of systems is important to elicit\\nfeatures of an underlying disease that might not be mentioned in the\\npatient’s narrative. In general, patients who feel comfortable with the\\nphysician will offer more complete information; thus, putting the\\npatient at ease contributes substantially to obtaining an adequate\\nhistory.\\nAn informative history is more than eliciting an orderly listing of\\nsymptoms. By listening to patients and noting the ways in which they\\ndescribe their symptoms, physicians can gain valuable insight.\\nInflections of voice, facial expression, gestures, and attitude (i.e.,\\n“body language”) may offer important clues to patients’ perception of\\nand reaction to their symptoms. Because patients vary considerably\\nin their medical sophistication and ability to recall facts, the reported\\nmedical history should be corroborated whenever possible. The\\nsocial history also can provide important insights into the types of\\ndiseases that should be considered and can identify practical\\nconsiderations for subsequent management. The family history not\\nonly identifies rare genetic disorders or common exposures, but\\noften reveals risk factors for common disorders, such as coronary'),\n",

A thorough\\nfamily history may require input from multiple relatives to ensure\\ncompleteness and accuracy. An experienced clinician can usually\\nformulate a relevant differential diagnosis from the history alone,\\nusing the physical examination and diagnostic tests to narrow the list\\nor reveal unexpected findings that lead to more focused inquiry.\\nThe very act of eliciting the history provides the physician with an\\nopportunity to establish or enhance a unique bond that can form the\\nbasis for a good patient–physician relationship. This process helps\\nthe physician develop an appreciation of the patient’s view of the\\nillness, the patient’s expectations of the physician and the health\\ncare system, and the financial and social implications of the illness\\nfor the patient. Although current health care settings may impose\\ntime constraints on patient visits, it is important not to rush the\\nencounter. A hurried approach may lead patients to believe that what\\nthey are relating is not of importance to the physician, and, as a\\nresult, they may withhold relevant information. The confidentiality of\\nthe patient–physician relationship cannot be overemphasized.\\nPhysical Examination The purpose of the physical examination is\\nto identify physical signs of disease. The significance of these\\nobjective indications of disease is enhanced when they confirm a\\nfunctional or structural change already suggested by the patient’s\\nhistory. At times, however, physical signs may be the only evidence\\nof disease and may not have been suggested by the history.\\nThe physical examination should be methodical and thorough,\\nwith consideration given to the patient’s comfort and modesty.\\nAlthough attention is often directed by the history to the diseased\\norgan or part of the body, the examination of a new patient must\\nextend from head to toe in an objective search for abnormalities. The\\nresults of the examination, like the details of the history, should be\\nrecorded at the time they are elicited—not hours later, when they are\\nsubject to the distortions of memory.

Although the skills of physical diagnosis are acquired\\nwith experience, it is not merely technique that determines success\\nin identifying signs of disease. The detection of a few scattered\\npetechiae, a faint diastolic murmur, or a small mass in the abdomen\\nis not a question of keener eyes and ears or more sensitive fingers,\\nbut of a mind alert to those findings. Because physical findings can\\nchange with time, the physical examination should be repeated as\\nfrequently as the clinical situation warrants.\\nGiven the many highly sensitive diagnostic tests now available\\n(particularly imaging techniques), it may be tempting to place less\\nemphasis on the physical examination. Some are critical of physical\\ndiagnosis based on perceived low levels of specificity and sensitivity.\\nIndeed, many patients are seen by consultants only after a series of\\ndiagnostic tests have been performed and the results are known.\\nThis fact should not deter the physician from performing a thorough\\nphysical examination since important clinical findings may have\\nescaped detection by diagnostic tests.

Screening tests are most informative\\nwhen they are directed toward common diseases and when their\\nresults indicate whether other potentially useful—but often costly—\\ntests or interventions are needed. On the one hand, biochemical\\nmeasurements, together with simple laboratory determinations such\\nas routine serum chemistries, blood counts, and urinalysis, often\\nprovide a major clue to the presence of a pathologic process.

An in-depth workup after the report of an isolated\\nlaboratory abnormality in a person who is otherwise well is often\\nwasteful and unproductive. Because so many tests are performed\\nroutinely for screening purposes, it is not unusual for one or two\\nvalues to be slightly abnormal. Nevertheless, even if there is no\\nreason to suspect an underlying illness, tests yielding abnormal\\nresults ordinarily are repeated to rule out laboratory error. If an\\nabnormality is confirmed, it is important to consider its potential\\nsignificance in the context of the patient’s condition and other test\\nresults.\\nThere is almost continual development of technically improved\\nimaging studies with greater sensitivity and specificity.

In light of their capabilities and the rapidity with\\nwhich they can lead to a diagnosis, it is tempting to order a battery of\\nimaging studies. All physicians have had experiences in which\\nimaging studies revealed findings that led to an unexpected\\ndiagnosis. Nonetheless, patients must endure each of these tests,'),\n",

Advances in medicine\\nhave increased our ability to manage very complex clinical situations\\n(e.g., intensive care units [ICUs], bone marrow transplantation) and\\nhave shifted the burden of disease toward chronic illnesses.\\nBecause an individual patient may have multiple chronic diseases,\\nhe or she may be cared for by several specialists as well as a\\nprimary care physician. In the inpatient setting, care may involve\\nmultiple consultants along with the primary admitting physician.\\nCommunication through the medical record is necessary but not\\nsufficient, particularly when patients have complex medical problems\\nor when difficult decisions need to be made about the optimal\\nmanagement plan.

Many medical schools have\\nincorporated interprofessional teamwork into their curricula. Effective\\ncommunication is inevitably the most challenging aspect of\\nimplementing team-based care. While communication can be aided\\nby electronic devices, including medical records, apps, or text\\nmessages, it is vitally important to balance efficiency with taking the\\nnecessary time to speak directly with colleagues.\\nThe Dichotomy of Inpatient and Outpatient Internal Medicine\\nThe hospital environment has undergone sweeping changes over\\nthe past few decades. Emergency departments and critical care\\nunits have evolved to manage critically ill patients, allowing them to\\nsurvive formerly fatal conditions. In parallel, there is increasing\\npressure to reduce the length of stay in the hospital and to manage\\ncomplex disorders in the outpatient setting. This transition has been\\ndriven not only by efforts to reduce costs but also by the availability\\nof new outpatient technologies, such as imaging and percutaneous\\ninfusion catheters for long-term antibiotics or nutrition, minimally\\ninvasive surgical procedures, and evidence that outcomes often are\\nimproved by reducing inpatient hospitalization.\\nIn addition to traditional medical beds, hospitals now encompass\\nmultiple distinct levels of care, such as the emergency department,\\nprocedure rooms, overnight observation units, critical care units, and\\npalliative care units. A consequence of this differentiation has been\\nthe emergence of new specialties (e.g., emergency medicine and\\nend-of-life care) and the provision of in-hospital care by hospitalists\\nand intensivists. Most hospitalists are board-certified internists who\\nbear primary responsibility for the care of hospitalized patients and\\nwhose work is limited entirely to the hospital setting.

Intensivists are board-certified physicians who are further\\ncertified in critical care medicine and who direct and provide care for\\nvery ill patients in critical care units. Clearly, an important challenge\\nin internal medicine today is to ensure the continuity of\\ncommunication and information flow between a patient’s primary\\ncare physician and those who are in charge of the patient’s hospital\\ncare. Maintaining these channels of communication is frequently\\ncomplicated by patient “handoffs”—i.e., transitions from the\\noutpatient to the inpatient environment, from the critical care unit to a\\ngeneral medicine floor, from a medical to a surgical service and vice\\nversa, from the hospital environment to the recently developed\\n“home hospital” setting (for select patients with adequate home\\nsupport), and from the hospital or home hospital to the outpatient\\nenvironment.\\nThe involvement of many care providers in conjunction with these\\ntransitions can threaten the traditional one-to-one relationship\\nbetween patient and primary care physician. Of course, patients can\\nbenefit greatly from effective collaboration among a number of health\\ncare professionals; however, it is the duty of the patient’s principal or\\nprimary physician to provide cohesive guidance through an illness.\\nTo meet this challenge, primary care physicians must be familiar with\\nthe techniques, skills, and objectives of specialist physicians and\\nallied health professionals who care for their patients in the hospital.\\nIn addition, primary care physicians must ensure that their patients\\nbenefit from scientific advances and the expertise of specialists, both\\nin and out of the hospital. Primary care physicians should explain the\\nrole of these specialists to reassure patients that they are in the\\nhands of physicians best trained to manage their current illness.\\nHowever, the primary care physician should assure patients and\\ntheir families that decisions are being made in consultation with\\nthese specialists.

However,\\nopposition and hesitancy to vaccines exist and are not new. Vaccine\\nhesitancy has existed since Edward Jenner introduced the first\\nvaccine against smallpox in the eighteenth century. So why did the\\nWorld Health Organization rank these attitudes as one of the ten\\ngreatest threats to public health in 2019? Are current opposition and\\nhesitancy any different from what has been seen before? Many\\nsociologists, public health experts, and health care providers (HCPs)\\nargue yes. Recent social and cultural trends, combined with new\\ncommunication formats, have converged to create a particularly\\npotent form of hesitancy and what some have labeled a crisis of\\nconfidence. This crisis manifests as a lack of trust in specific\\nvaccines, vaccine programs, researchers, HCPs, the health care\\nsystem, pharmaceutical companies, academics, policymakers,\\ngovernments, and authority in general. (See “Focus: COVID-19\\nVaccine Hesitancy,” below.)\\nThe roots of modern vaccine hesitancy and opposition—defined\\nas delay or rejection of vaccines in spite of availability—vary\\ndepending on the place and the population. For some individuals\\nand communities, pseudoscience and false claims about the safety\\nof existing vaccines (e.g., an unsupported link between measles\\nvaccine and autism) have driven fears, increased hesitancy, and\\ndecreased acceptance. For others, real safety events, such as the\\nassociation of narcolepsy with a specific pandemic influenza vaccine\\n(Pandemrix), have justified concerns.

An individual may be fully vaccinated but still be hesitant\\nabout the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, or an individual may\\nbe unvaccinated as a result of access issues but may not be\\nhesitant. Therefore, in attempts to understand a patient’s lack of\\nvaccination, it is important to distinguish persons who are hesitant\\nand refuse vaccines from those who need assistance to access the\\nhealth care system and successfully complete vaccination. To this\\nend, an understanding of vaccine hesitancy and its determinants is\\nneeded.\\nVaccine hesitancy and opposition are defined by the World\\nHealth Organization’s SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy\\nas a “delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability\\nof vaccination services.” The SAGE group describes vaccine\\nhesitancy as “complex and context specific, varying across time,\\nplace, and vaccines.”\\nIt is useful to frame vaccine acceptance as a continuum pyramid,\\nwith active demand for all vaccines representing the largest group at\\nthe bottom of the pyramid and outright refusal of all vaccines\\ndepicted in the smallest group at the top. In the middle lies vaccine\\nhesitancy, in which the degree of vaccine demand and acceptance\\nvaries. Fortunately, for disease control efforts, most individuals fall\\nwithin the active-demand category or, if they are hesitant, still accept\\nall vaccines. Hesitancy can be influenced by complacency,\\nconvenience, and confidence (Fig. 3-1).'),\n",

Wong\\nPracticing medicine at its core requires making decisions. What\\nmakes medical practice so difficult is not only the specialized\\ntechnical knowledge required but also the intrinsic uncertainty that\\nsurrounds each decision. Mastering the technical aspects of\\nmedicine alone, unfortunately, does not ensure a mastery of the\\npractice of medicine. Sir William Osler’s familiar quote “Medicine is a\\nscience of uncertainty and an art of probability” captures well this\\ncomplex duality. Although the science of medicine is often taught as\\nif the mechanisms of the human body operate with Newtonian\\npredictability, every aspect of medical practice is infused with an\\nelement of irreducible uncertainty that the clinician ignores at her\\nperil. Although deeply rooted in science, more than 100 years after\\nthe practice of medicine took its modern form, it remains at its core a\\ncraft, to which individual doctors bring varying levels of skill and\\nunderstanding. With the exponential growth in medical literature and\\nother technical information and an ever-increasing number of testing\\nand treatment options, twenty-first century physicians who seek\\nexcellence in their craft must master a more diverse and complex set\\nof skills than any of the generations that preceded them. This\\nchapter provides an introduction to three of the pillars upon which\\nthe craft of modern medicine rests: (1) expertise in clinical reasoning\\n(what it is and how it can be developed); (2) rational diagnostic test\\nuse and interpretation; and (3) integration of the best available\\nresearch evidence with clinical judgment in the care of individual\\npatients (evidence-based medicine [EBM]).\\n■ BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO CLINICAL REASONING\\nClinical Expertise Defining “clinical expertise” remains surprisingly\\ndifficult.

At each institution, there\\nare often a few “elite” clinicians who are known for their “special\\nproblem-solving prowess” when particularly difficult or obscure cases\\nhave baffled everyone else. Yet despite their skill, even such master\\nclinicians typically cannot explain their exact processes and\\nmethods, thereby limiting the acquisition and dissemination of the\\nexpertise used to achieve their impressive results. Furthermore,\\nclinical virtuosity appears not to be generalizable, e.g., an expert on\\nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be no better (and possibly worse)\\nthan a first-year medical resident at diagnosing and managing a\\npatient with neutropenia, fever, and hypotension.\\nBroadly construed, clinical expertise encompasses not only\\ncognitive dimensions involving the integration of disease knowledge\\nwith verbal and visual cues and test interpretation but also potentially\\nthe complex fine-motor skills necessary for invasive procedures and\\ntests.

Research on medical expertise\\nremains sparse overall and mostly centered on diagnostic reasoning,\\nso in this chapter, we focus primarily on the cognitive elements of\\nclinical reasoning.\\nBecause clinical reasoning occurs in the heads of clinicians,\\nobjective study of the process is difficult. One research method used\\nfor this area asks clinicians to “think out loud” as they receive\\nincrements of clinical information in a manner meant to simulate a\\nclinical encounter. Another research approach focuses on how\\ndoctors should reason diagnostically, to identify remediable “errors,”\\nrather than on how they actually do reason. Much of what is known\\nabout clinical reasoning comes from empirical studies of nonmedical\\nproblem-solving behavior. Because of the diverse perspectives\\ncontributing to this area, with important contributions from cognitive\\npsychology, medical education, behavioral economics, sociology,\\ninformatics, and decision sciences, no single integrated model of\\nclinical reasoning exists, and not infrequently, different terms and\\nreasoning models describe similar phenomena.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': \"data/Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine.pdf\"}, page_content='Intuitive Versus Analytic Reasoning A useful contemporary model\\nof reasoning, the dual-process theory distinguishes two general\\nconceptual modes of thinking as fast or slow. Intuition (System 1)\\nprovides rapid effortless judgments from memorized associations\\nusing pattern recognition and other simplifying “rules of thumb” (i.e.,\\nheuristics). For example, a very simple pattern that could be useful in\\ncertain situations is “black woman plus hilar adenopathy equals\\nsarcoid.” Because no effort is involved in recalling the pattern, the\\nclinician is often unable to say how those judgments were\\nformulated. In contrast, Analysis (System 2), the other form of\\nreasoning in the dual-process model, is slow, methodical,\\ndeliberative, and effortful. A student might read about causes of hilar\\nadenopathy and from that list (e.g., Chap. 66), identify diseases\\nmore common in black women or examine the patient for skin or eye\\nfindings that occur with sarcoid. These dual processes, of course,\\nrepresent two exemplars taken from the cognitive continuum. They\\nprovide helpful descriptive insights but very little guidance in how to\\ndevelop expertise in clinical reasoning. How these idealized systems\\ninteract in different decision problems, how experts use them\\ndifferently from novices, and when their use can lead to errors in\\njudgment remain the subject of study and considerable debate.\\nPattern recognition, an important part of System 1 reasoning, is a\\ncomplex cognitive process that appears largely effortless. One can\\nrecognize people’s faces, the breed of a dog, an automobile model,\\nor a piece of music from just a few notes within milliseconds without\\nnecessarily being able to articulate the specific features that\\nprompted the recognition. Analogously, experienced clinicians often\\nrecognize familiar diagnostic patterns very quickly. The key here is\\nhaving a large library of stored patterns that can be rapidly\\naccessed. In the absence of an extensive stored repertoire of\\ndiagnostic patterns, students (as well as experienced clinicians\\noperating outside their area of expertise and familiarity) often must\\nuse the more laborious System 2 analytic approach along with more\\nintensive and comprehensive data collection to reach the diagnosis.\\nThe following brief patient scenarios illustrate three distinct\\npatterns associated with hemoptysis that experienced clinicians\\nrecognize without effort:'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': \"data/Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine.pdf\"}, page_content='• A 46-year-old man presents to his internist with a chief complaint of\\nhemoptysis. An otherwise healthy, nonsmoker, he is recovering\\nfrom an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern\\nsuggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to\\nacute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient\\nreassurance that a more serious disorder is absent.\\n• In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same\\nchief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a\\nproductive morning cough with blood-streaked sputum, and weight\\nloss fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along\\nwith the chest x-ray, the clinician obtains a sputum cytology\\nexamination and refers this patient for a chest CT scan.\\n• In the third scenario, the clinician hears a soft diastolic rumbling\\nmurmur at the apex on cardiac auscultation in a 46-year-old patient\\nwith hemoptysis who immigrated from a developing country and\\norders an echocardiogram as well, because of possible pulmonary\\nhypertension from suspected rheumatic mitral stenosis.\\nPattern recognition by itself is not, however, sufficient for secure\\ndiagnosis. Without deliberative systematic reflection, undisciplined\\npattern recognition can result in premature closure: mistakenly\\njumping to the conclusion that one has the correct diagnosis before\\nall the relevant data are in. A critical second step, therefore, even\\nwhen the diagnosis seems obvious, is diagnostic verification:\\nconsidering whether the diagnosis adequately accounts for the\\npresenting symptoms and signs and can explain all the ancillary\\nfindings. The following case based on a real clinical encounter\\nprovides an example of premature closure. A 45-year-old man\\npresents with a 3-week history of a “flulike” upper respiratory\\ninfection (URI) including dyspnea and a productive cough. The\\nemergency department (ED) clinician pulled out a “URI assessment\\nform,” which defines and standardizes the information gathered.\\nAfter quickly acquiring the requisite structured examination\\ncomponents and noting in particular the absence of fever and a clear\\nchest examination, the physician prescribed a cough suppressant for\\nacute bronchitis and reassured the patient that his illness was not\\nserious.

Presumably, the ED clinician felt\\nthat the patient was basically healthy (one can be misled by the way\\nthe patient appears on examination—a patient that does not appear\\n“sick” may be incorrectly assumed to have an innocuous illness). So,\\nin this case, the physician, upon hearing the overview of the patient\\nfrom the triage nurse, elected to use the URI assessment protocol\\neven before starting the history, closing consideration of the broader\\nrange of possibilities and associated tests required to confirm or\\nrefute these possibilities.

Two major research programs have studied\\nheuristics in a mostly nonmedical context and have reached very\\ndifferent conclusions about the value of these cognitive tools.

In contrast, the “fast and frugal\\nheuristics” research program explores how and when relying on\\nsimple heuristics can produce good decisions. Although many\\nheuristics have relevance to clinical reasoning, only four will be\\nmentioned here.\\nWhen diagnosing patients, clinicians usually develop diagnostic\\nhypotheses based on the similarity of that patient’s symptoms, signs,\\nand other data to their mental representations (memorized patterns)\\nof the disease possibilities.

Consider a patient with hypertension\\nwho has headache, palpitations, and diaphoresis. Based on the\\nrepresentativeness heuristic, clinicians might judge\\npheochromocytoma to be quite likely given this classic presenting\\nsymptom triad suggesting pheochromocytoma. Doing so, however,\\nwould be incorrect given that other causes of hypertension are much\\nmore common than pheochromocytoma and this triad of symptoms\\ncan occur in patients who do not have it. Thus, clinicians using the\\nrepresentativeness heuristic may overestimate the likelihood of a\\nparticular disease based on the presence of representative\\nsymptoms and signs, failing to account for its low underlying\\nprevalence (i.e., the prior, or pretest, probabilities). Conversely,\\natypical presentations of common diseases may lead to\\nunderestimating the likelihood of a particular disease. Thus,\\ninexperience with a specific disease and with the breadth of its\\npresentations may also lead to diagnostic delays or errors, e.g.,\\ndiseases that affect multiple organ systems, such as sarcoid or\\ntuberculosis, may be particularly challenging to diagnose because of\\nthe many different patterns they may manifest.\\nA second commonly used cognitive shortcut, the availability\\nheuristic, involves judgments based on how easily prior similar cases\\nor outcomes can be brought to mind. For example, a clinician may\\nrecall a case from a morbidity and mortality conference in which an\\nelderly patient presented with painless dyspnea of acute onset and\\nwas evaluated for a pulmonary cause but was eventually found to\\nhave acute MI, with the diagnostic delay likely contributing to the\\ndevelopment of ischemic cardiomyopathy. If the case was\\nassociated with a malpractice accusation, such examples may be\\neven more memorable. Errors with the availability heuristic arise\\nfrom several sources of recall bias. Rare catastrophic outcomes\\nbecome memorable cases with a clarity and force disproportionate to\\ntheir likelihood for future diagnosis—for example, a patient with a\\nsore throat eventually found to have leukemia or a young athlete with\\nleg pain subsequently found to have an osteosarcoma—and those\\npublicized in the media or recently experienced are, of course, easier\\nto recall and therefore more influential on clinical judgments.'),\n",

For example, a clinician\\nmay still judge the probability of coronary artery disease (CAD) to be\\nhigh despite a negative exercise perfusion test and go on to cardiac\\ncatheterization (see “Measures of Disease Probability and Bayes’\\nRule,” below).\\nThe fourth heuristic states that clinicians should use the simplest\\nexplanation possible that will adequately account for the patient’s\\nsymptoms and findings (Occam’s razor or, alternatively, the simplicity\\nheuristic).

The focused physical examination contributes to further\\ndistinguishing the working hypotheses. Is the spleen enlarged? How\\nbig is the liver? Is it tender? Are there any palpable masses or\\nnodules? Diagnostic verification involves testing the adequacy\\n(whether the diagnosis accounts for all symptoms and signs) and\\ncoherency (whether the signs and symptoms are consistent with the\\nunderlying pathophysiologic causal mechanism) of the working\\ndiagnosis.

Chest discomfort that is not\\nprovoked or worsened by exertion and not relieved by rest in an\\nactive patient lowers the likelihood that chronic ischemic heart\\ndisease is the underlying cause. The absence of a resting\\ntachycardia and thyroid gland enlargement reduces the likelihood of\\nhyperthyroidism in a patient with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.\\nThe acuity of a patient’s illness may override considerations of\\nprevalence and the other issues described above. “Diagnostic\\nimperatives” recognize the significance of relatively rare but\\npotentially catastrophic conditions if undiagnosed and untreated.

These factors can be grouped conceptually\\ninto three overlapping categories: (1) factors related to an individual\\nphysician’s practice, (2) factors related to practice setting, and (3)\\nfactors related to payment systems.\\nFactors Related to Practice Style To ensure that necessary care is\\nprovided at a high level of quality, physicians fulfill a key role in\\nmedical care by serving as the patient’s advocate. Factors that\\ninfluence performance in this role include the physician’s knowledge,\\ntraining, and experience. Clearly, physicians cannot practice EBM if\\nthey are unfamiliar with the evidence. As would be expected,\\nspecialists generally know the evidence in their field better than do\\ngeneralists. Beyond published evidence and practice guidelines, a\\nmajor set of influences on physician practice can be subsumed\\nunder the general concept of “practice style.” The practice style\\nserves to define norms of clinical behavior. Differing practice styles\\nmay be based on training, personal experience, and medical\\nevidence. Beliefs about effectiveness of different therapies and\\npreferred patterns of diagnostic test use are examples of different\\nfacets of a practice style. For example, cardiologists evaluating\\npatients with lower risk chest pain symptoms often conceptualize\\ntheir primary diagnostic objective as maximizing the detection of\\nischemia. For this reason, they may strongly favor stress imaging.'),\n",

This practice involves ordering\\ntests and therapies with very small marginal benefits, ostensibly to\\npreclude future criticism should an adverse outcome occur. With\\nconscious or unconscious awareness of a connection to the risk of\\nlitigation or to payment, however, over time, such patterns of care\\nmay become accepted as part of the practice norm, thereby\\nperpetuating their overuse, e.g., annual cardiac exercise testing in\\nasymptomatic patients.\\nPractice Setting Factors Factors in this category relate to work\\nsystems including tasks and workflow (interruptions, inefficiencies,\\nworkload), technology (poor design or implementation, errors in use,\\nfailure, misuse), organizational characteristics (e.g., culture,\\nleadership, staffing, scheduling), and the physical environment (e.g.,\\nnoise, lighting, layout).

Historically, physicians are paid on a fee-for-service,\\ncapitation, or salary basis. In fee-for-service, physicians who do\\nmore get paid more, thereby encouraging overuse, consciously or\\nunconsciously. When fees are reduced (discounted reimbursement),\\nclinicians tend to increase the number of services provided to\\nmaintain revenue. Capitation, in contrast, provides a fixed payment\\nper patient per year to encourage physicians to consider a global\\npopulation budget in managing individual patients and ideally\\nreducing the use of interventions with small marginal benefit. To\\ndiscourage volume-based excessive utilization, fixed salary\\ncompensation plans pay physicians the same regardless of the\\nclinical effort expended but may provide an (unintended) incentive to\\nsee fewer patients.

The next section\\nreviews select concepts related to diagnostic testing.\\n■ DIAGNOSTIC TESTING: MEASURES OF TEST ACCURACY\\nThe purpose of performing a test on a patient is to reduce\\nuncertainty about the patient’s diagnosis or prognosis in order to\\nfacilitate appropriate management. Although diagnostic tests\\ncommonly refer to laboratory (e.g., blood count) or imaging tests or\\nprocedures (e.g., colonoscopy or bronchoscopy), any information\\nthat changes a provider’s understanding of the patient’s problem\\nqualifies as a diagnostic test. Thus, even the history and physical\\nexamination can be considered as diagnostic tests. In clinical\\nmedicine, it is common to reduce the results of a test to a\\ndichotomous outcome, such as positive or negative, normal or\\nabnormal. Although this simplification often suppresses useful\\ninformation (such as the degree of abnormality), it facilitates\\nillustrating some important principles of test interpretation that are\\ndescribed below.\\nThe accuracy of any diagnostic test is assessed relative to a\\n“gold standard,” where a positive gold standard test defines the\\npatients who have disease and a negative test securely rules out\\ndisease (Table 4-1). Characterizing the diagnostic performance of a\\nnew test requires identifying an appropriate population (ideally,\\npatients representative of those in whom the new test would be\\nused) and applying both the new and the gold standard tests to all\\nsubjects. Biased estimates of test performance occur when\\ndiagnostic accuracy is defined using an inappropriate population or\\none in which gold standard determination of disease status is\\nincomplete. The accuracy of the new test in distinguishing disease\\nfrom health is determined relative to the gold standard results and\\nsummarized in four estimates. The sensitivity or true-positive rate\\nreflects how well the new test identifies patients with disease. It is\\nthe proportion of patients with disease (defined by the gold standard)\\nwho have a positive test. The proportion of patients with disease who\\nhave a negative test is the false-negative rate, calculated as 1 –\\nsensitivity. The specificity, or true-negative rate, reflects how well the'),\n",

It is the\\nproportion of patients without disease (defined by the gold standard)\\nwho have a negative test. The proportion of patients without disease\\nwho have positive test is the false-positive rate, calculated as 1 –\\nspecificity. In theory, a perfect test would be one with a sensitivity of\\n100% and a specificity of 100% and would completely distinguish\\npatients with disease from those without it. A useful mnemonic to\\nhelp remember the somewhat paradoxical relationship between what\\nthe test is best at technically versus what it is most useful for\\nclinically is: a test with a very high sensitivity (Sn) when negative (N)\\nhelps rule out (out) disease (SnNout), and a test with a very high\\nspecificity (Sp) when positive (P) helps rule in (in) disease (SpPin).\\nTABLE 4-1 Measures of Diagnostic Test Accuracy\\nCalculating sensitivity and specificity requires selection of a\\nthreshold value or cut point above which the test is considered\\n“positive.” Making the cut point “stricter” (e.g., raising it) lowers\\nsensitivity but improves specificity, while making it “laxer” (e.g.,\\nlowering it) raises sensitivity but lowers specificity. This dynamic\\ntrade-off between more accurate identification of subjects with\\ndisease versus those without disease is often displayed graphically\\nas a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Fig. 4-1) by\\nplotting sensitivity (y axis) versus 1 – specificity (x axis).

The choice of\\ncut point may also depend on the prevalence of disease, with low\\nprevalence placing a greater emphasis on the harms of false-positive\\ntests (e.g., HIV testing in marriage applicants) or the harms of false-\\nnegative tests (e.g., HIV testing in blood donors).'),\n",

For some common\\nconditions, such as CAD, existing nomograms and statistical models\\ngenerate estimates of pretest probability that account for history,\\nphysical examination, and test findings. The posttest probability (also\\ncalled the predictive value of the test, see below) is a recalibrated\\nstatement of the probability of the diagnosis, accounting for both\\npretest probability and test results.

Unfortunately, clinicians commonly misinterpret\\nreported predictive values as intrinsic measures of test accuracy\\nrather than calculated probabilities. Studies of diagnostic test\\nperformance compound the confusion by calculating predictive\\nvalues from the same sample used to measure sensitivity and\\nspecificity.

A positive\\ntreadmill ST-segment response has an average sensitivity of ∼ 60%\\nand an average specificity of ∼ 75%, yielding a likelihood ratio\\npositive of 2.4 (0.60/[1 – 0.75]) (consistent with modest\\ndiscriminatory ability because it falls between 2 and 5). For a 41-\\nyear-old man with nonanginal pain and a 10% pretest probability of\\nCAD, the posttest probability of disease after a positive result rises to\\nonly ∼ 30%. For a 60-year-old woman with typical angina and a\\npretest probability of CAD of 80%, a positive test result raises the\\nposttest probability of disease to ∼ 95%.\\nIn contrast, exercise SPECT myocardial perfusion test is more\\naccurate for diagnosis of CAD. For simplicity, assume that the finding\\nof a reversible exercise-induced perfusion defect has both a\\nsensitivity and a specificity of 90% (a bit higher than reported),\\nyielding a likelihood ratio for a positive test of 9.0 (0.90/[1 – 0.90])\\n(consistent with intermediate discriminatory ability because it falls\\nbetween 5 and 10). For the same 10% pretest probability patient, a\\npositive test raises the probability of CAD to 50% (Fig. 4-2).\\nHowever, despite the differences in posttest probabilities between\\nthese two tests (30 vs 50%), the more accurate test may not improve\\ndiagnostic likelihood enough to change patient management (e.g.,\\ndecision to refer to cardiac catheterization) because the more\\naccurate test has only moved the physician from being fairly certain\\nthat the patient did not have CAD to a 50:50 chance of disease. In a\\npatient with a pretest probability of 80%, exercise SPECT test raises\\nthe posttest probability to 97% (compared with 95% for the exercise\\ntreadmill). Again, the more accurate test does not provide enough\\nimprovement in posttest confidence to alter management, and\\nneither test has improved much on what was known from clinical\\ndata alone.\\nIn general, positive results with an accurate test (e.g., likelihood\\nratio for a positive test of 10) when the pretest probability is low (e.g.,\\n20%) do not move the posttest probability to a range high enough to\\nrule in disease (e.g., 80%).

For example, in screening first-time female blood donors\\nwithout risk factors for HIV, a positive test raised the likelihood of HIV\\nto only 67% despite a specificity of 99.995% because the prevalence\\nwas 0.01%. Conversely, with a high pretest probability, a negative\\ntest may not rule out disease adequately if it is not sufficiently\\nsensitive. Thus, the largest change in diagnostic likelihood following\\na test result occurs when the clinician is most uncertain (i.e., pretest\\nprobability between 30 and 70%). For example, in patients with a\\npretest probability for CAD of 50%, a positive exercise treadmill test\\nmoves the posttest probability to 80% and a positive exercise\\nSPECT perfusion test moves it to 90% (Fig. 4-2).\\nAs presented above, Bayes’ rule employs a number of important\\nsimplifications that should be considered. First, few tests provide\\nonly “positive” or “negative” results.

Similarly, when multiple sequential tests are performed, the\\nposttest probability may be used as the pretest probability to\\ninterpret the second test. However, this simplification assumes\\nconditional independence—that is, that the results of the first test do\\nnot affect the likelihood of the second test result—and this is often\\nnot true.\\nFinally, many texts assert that sensitivity and specificity are\\nprevalence-independent parameters of test accuracy. This\\nstatistically useful assumption, however, is often incorrect. A\\ntreadmill exercise test, for example, has a sensitivity of ∼ 30% in a\\npopulation of patients with one-vessel CAD, whereas its sensitivity in\\npatients with severe three-vessel CAD approaches 80%. Thus, the\\nbest estimate of sensitivity to use in a particular decision may vary,\\ndepending on the severity of disease in the local population. A\\nhospitalized, symptomatic, or referral population typically has a\\nhigher prevalence of disease and, in particular, a higher prevalence\\nof more advanced disease than does an outpatient population.'),\n",

Starting in the spring of 2020,\\ncase reports, personal and institutional anecdotal experience, and\\nsmall single-center case series started appearing in the peer-\\nreviewed literature and within months turned into a flood of confusing\\nand often contradictory evidence. Observational reports of\\ntreatments for COVID-19 fueled the confusion. Despite >40,000\\npublications appearing in the first 7 months of the pandemic, an\\nenormous amount of uncertainty around prevention, diagnosis,\\ntreatment, and prognosis of the disease remained.

Meta-analysis is research that combines and\\nsummarizes the available evidence quantitatively. Although it is used\\nto examine nonrandomized studies, meta-analysis is most useful for\\nsummarizing all available randomized trials examining a particular\\ntherapy used in a specific clinical context.

Meta-analysis can especially help\\ndetect benefits when individual trials are inadequately powered (e.g.,\\nthe benefits of streptokinase thrombolytic therapy in acute MI\\ndemonstrated by ISIS-2 in 1988 were evident by the early 1970s\\nthrough meta-analysis).

Clinicians\\nshould also examine what absolute risk reduction (ARR) can be\\nexpected from the therapy. A metric of absolute treatment benefit\\nthat is frequently reported is the number needed to treat (NNT) to\\nprevent one adverse outcome event (e.g., death, stroke). NNT\\nshould not be interpreted literally as a causal statement. NNT is\\nsimply 1/ARR. For example, if a hypothetical therapy reduced\\nmortality rates over a 5-year follow-up by 33% (the relative treatment\\nbenefit) from 12% (control arm) to 8% (treatment arm), the ARR\\nwould be 12% – 8% = 4% and the NNT would be 1/.04, or 25. This\\ndoes not mean literally that 1 patient benefits and 24 do not.\\nHowever, it can be conceptualized as an informal measure of\\ntreatment efficiency. If the hypothetical treatment was applied to a\\nlower-risk population, say, with a 6% 5-year mortality, the 33%\\nrelative treatment benefit would reduce absolute mortality by 2%\\n(from 6% to 4%), and the NNT for the same therapy in this lower-risk\\ngroup of patients would be 50. Although not always made explicit,\\ncomparisons of NNT estimates from different studies should account\\nfor the duration of follow-up used to create each estimate. In\\naddition, the NNT concept assumes a homogeneity in response to\\ntreatment that may not be accurate. The NNT is simply another way\\nof summarizing the absolute treatment difference and does not\\nprovide any unique information.\\n■ CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES\\nPer the 1990 Institute of Medicine definition, clinical practice\\nguidelines are “systematically developed statements to assist\\npractitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for\\nspecific clinical circumstances.” This definition emphasizes several\\ncrucial features of modern guideline development. First, guidelines\\nare created by using the tools of EBM. In particular, the core of the\\ndevelopment process is a systematic literature search followed by a\\nreview of the relevant peer-reviewed literature. Second, guidelines\\nusually are focused on a clinical disorder (e.g., diabetes mellitus,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': \"data/Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine.pdf\"}, page_content='stable angina pectoris) or a health care intervention (e.g., cancer\\nscreening). Third, the primary objective of guidelines is to improve\\nthe quality of medical care by identifying care practices that should\\nbe routinely implemented, based on high-quality evidence and high\\nbenefit-to-harm ratios for the interventions. Guidelines are intended\\nto “assist” decision-making, not to define explicitly what decisions\\nshould be made in a particular situation, in part because guideline-\\nlevel evidence alone is never sufficient for clinical decision-making\\n(e.g., deciding whether to intubate and administer antibiotics for\\npneumonia in a terminally ill individual, in an individual with\\ndementia, or in an otherwise healthy 30-year-old mother).\\nGuidelines are narrative documents constructed by expert panels\\nwhose composition often is determined by interested professional\\norganizations. These panels vary in expertise and in the degree to\\nwhich they represent all relevant stakeholders. The guideline\\ndocuments consist of a series of specific management\\nrecommendations, a summary indication of the quantity and quality\\nof evidence supporting each recommendation, an assessment of the\\nbenefit-to-harm ratio for the recommendation, and a narrative\\ndiscussion of the recommendations. Many recommendations simply\\nreflect the expert consensus of the guideline panel because\\nliterature-based evidence is insufficient or absent. A recent\\nexamination of this issue in cardiovascular guidelines showed that\\n<15% of guideline recommendations were based on the highest\\nlevel of clinical trial evidence, and this proportion had not improved in\\n10 years despite a substantial number of trials being conducted and\\npublished. The final step in guideline construction is peer review,\\nfollowed by a final revision in response to the critiques provided.\\nGuidelines are closely tied to the process of quality improvement\\nin medicine through their identification of evidence-based best\\npractices. Such practices can be used as quality indicators.\\nExamples include the proportion of acute MI patients who receive\\naspirin upon admission to a hospital and the proportion of heart\\nfailure patients with a depressed ejection fraction treated with an\\nACE inhibitor.'),\n",

However, EBM provides practitioners with\\nan ideal rather than a finished set of tools with which to manage\\npatients. Moreover, even with such evidence, it is always worth\\nremembering that the response to therapy of the “average” patient\\nrepresented by the summary clinical trial outcomes may not be what\\ncan be expected for the specific patient sitting in front of a provider in\\nthe clinic or hospital.

In this rubric, the definition of any\\ndisease is largely based on clinicopathologic observation. As the\\ncorrelation between clinical signs and symptoms with pathoanatomy\\nrequired autopsy material, diseases tended to be characterized by\\nthe end organ in which the primary syndrome was manifest and by\\nlate-stage presentations. Morgagni institutionalized this framework\\nwith the publication of De Sedibus et Causis Morborum per\\nAnatomen Indagatis in 1761, in which he correlated the clinical\\nfeatures of patients with more than 600 autopsies at the University of\\nPadua, demonstrating an anatomic basis for disease\\npathophysiology. Clinicopathologic observation served as the basis\\nfor inductive generalization coupled with the application of Occam’s\\nrazor in which disease complexity was reduced to its simplest\\npossible form. While this approach to defining human disease has\\nheld sway for over a century and facilitated the conquest of many\\ndiseases previously considered incurable, overly inclusive and\\nsimplified Oslerian diagnostics suffer from significant shortcomings.\\nThese include, but are not limited to, failure to distinguish the\\nunderlying etiology of different diseases with common\\npathophenotypes. For example, many different diseases can cause\\nend-stage kidney disease or heart failure. Over time, the\\nclassification of neurodegenerative disorders or lymphomas, as well\\nas many other diseases, is becoming more refined and precise as\\nthe underlying etiologies are identified. These distinctions are\\nimportant for providing predictable prognostic information for\\nindividual patients with even highly prevalent diseases. Additionally,\\ntherapies may be ineffective owing to a lack of understanding of the\\noften subtle molecular complexities of specific disease drivers.'),\n",

A unique limitation of cancer in this regard, however, is that the\\nfrequency of somatic mutations over time (and, especially, with\\ntreatment) is great and the functional consequences of many of\\nthese mutations unknown. Equally important, assessment of single-\\ncell mRNA sequencing patterns demonstrates great variability\\nbetween apparently similar cells, challenging functional\\ninterpretation. Lastly, in solid tumors, stromal cells interact in a\\nvariety of ways (e.g., metabolically) with the associated malignant\\ncells, and their gene expression signatures are also modified by the\\nchanging somatic mutational landscape of the primary malignancy.\\nThus, while much more information can be obtained over time in'),\n",

Martin\\nA primary goal of health care is to prevent disease or detect it early\\nenough that intervention will be more effective. Tremendous\\nprogress has been made toward this goal over the past 50 years.\\nScreening tests are available for many common diseases and\\nencompass biochemical (e.g., cholesterol, glucose), physiologic\\n(e.g., blood pressure, growth curves), radiologic (e.g., mammogram,\\nbone densitometry), and cytologic (e.g., Pap smear) approaches.\\nEffective preventive interventions have resulted in dramatic declines\\nin mortality from many diseases, particularly infections. Preventive\\ninterventions include counseling about risk behaviors, vaccinations,\\nmedications, and, in some relatively uncommon settings, surgery.\\nPreventive services (including screening tests, preventive\\ninterventions, and counseling) are different than other medical\\ninterventions because they are proactively administered to healthy\\nindividuals instead of in response to a symptom, sign, or diagnosis.\\nThus, the decision to recommend a screening test or preventive\\nintervention requires a particularly high bar of evidence that testing\\nand intervention are both practical and effective.\\n Because population-based screening and prevention\\nstrategies must be extremely low risk to have an acceptable benefit-\\nto-harm ratio, the ability to target individuals who are more likely to\\ndevelop disease could enable the application of a wider set of\\npotential approaches and increase efficiency. Currently, there are\\nmany types of data that can predict disease incidence in an\\nasymptomatic individual. Germline genomic data have received the\\nmost attention to date, at least in part because mutations in high-\\npenetrance genes have clear implications for preventive care (Chap.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': \"data/Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine.pdf\"}, page_content='467). Women with mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2, the two\\nmajor breast cancer susceptibility genes identified to date, have a\\nmarkedly increased risk (five- to twentyfold) of breast and ovarian\\ncancer. Screening and prevention recommendations include\\nprophylactic oophorectomy and breast magnetic resonance imaging\\n(MRI), both of which are considered to incur too much harm for\\nwomen at average cancer risk. Some women with BRCA mutations\\nopt for prophylactic mastectomy to dramatically reduce their breast\\ncancer risk. Although the proportion of common disease explained\\nby high-penetrance genes appears to be relatively small (5–10% of\\nmost diseases), mutations in rare, moderate-penetrance genes, and\\nvariants in low-penetrance genes, also contribute to the prediction of\\ndisease risk. Most recently, polygenic risk scores combining\\ninformation about variants across hundreds of genes are being\\nevaluated for identifying individuals at high risk of coronary heart\\ndisease and other conditions. The advent of affordable whole\\nexome/whole genome sequencing is likely to speed the\\ndissemination of these tests into clinical practice and may transform\\nthe delivery of preventive care.\\nOther forms of “omic” data also have the potential to provide\\nimportant predictive information. Proteomics and metabolomics can\\nprovide insight into gene function, but it has proven challenging to\\ndevelop reliable, predictive measures using these platforms. More\\nrecently, it has become possible to measure the presence of\\nmutations in DNA circulating in the bloodstream and in stool, with\\nearly promising evidence that these assays can be used to detect\\ncancer before existing screening tests.\\nIn addition to “omic” data, imaging data are increasingly being\\nintegrated into risk-stratified prevention approaches as evidence\\ngrows about the predictive ability of these data. For example,\\ncoronary computed tomography (CT) scans are used in many\\npreventive cardiology programs to inform decisions about beginning\\nstatin therapy when there is conflicting or uncertain information from\\nother risk assessment approaches. Of course, these data may also\\nbe helpful in predicting the risk of harms from screening or\\nprevention, such as the risk of a false-positive mammogram.'),\n",

Thus, many\\nscreening strategies are targeted at these conditions. From a global\\nhealth perspective, these conditions are priorities, but malaria,\\nmalnutrition, AIDS, tuberculosis, and violence also carry a heavy\\ndisease burden (Chap. 472).\\nTABLE 6-2 Lifetime Cumulative Risk\\nHaving an effective treatment for early disease has proven\\nchallenging for some common diseases. For example, although\\nAlzheimer’s disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United\\nStates, there are no curative treatments and no evidence that early\\ntreatment improves outcomes.

The short\\ninterval between the ability to detect disease on a screening test and\\nthe development of incurable disease also contributes to the limited\\neffectiveness of mammography screening in reducing deaths from\\nsome forms of breast cancer. At the other end of the spectrum, the\\nearly detection of prostate cancer may not lead to a difference in the\\nmortality rate because the disease is often indolent and competing\\nmorbidities, such as coronary artery disease, may ultimately cause\\nmortality (Chap. 70).

Thus, within a fixed period of time, a screened\\npopulation will have a greater proportion of these slowly progressive\\ncases and will appear to have better disease survival than an\\nunscreened population.\\nA variety of endpoints are used to assess the potential gain from\\nscreening and preventive interventions.\\n1. The absolute and relative impact of screening on disease\\nincidence or mortality. The absolute difference in disease\\nincidence or mortality between a screened and nonscreened\\ngroup allows the comparison of size of the benefit across\\npreventive services. A meta-analysis of Swedish mammography\\ntrials (ages 40–70) found that ∼ 1.2 fewer women per 1000 would\\ndie from breast cancer if they were screened over a 12-year\\nperiod. By comparison, at least ∼ 3 lives per 1000 would be saved\\nfrom colon cancer in a population (aged 50–75) screened with\\nannual fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) over a 13-year period,\\nand an estimated 20–24 lives per 1000 would be saved over the\\nentire 25-year period.

For some tests such as\\nscreening mammography and screening chest CT, a false-positive\\nresult occurs when an abnormality is identified that is not malignant,\\nrequiring either a biopsy diagnosis or short-term follow-up. For other\\ntests such as Pap smears, a false-positive result occurs because the\\ntest identifies a wide range of potentially premalignant states, only a\\nsmall percentage of which would ever progress to an invasive\\ncancer.

The costs include not\\nonly the expense of the intervention but also time away from work,\\ndownstream costs from false-positive results, “incidentalomas” or\\nadverse events, and other potential harms. Cost-effectiveness is\\ntypically assessed by calculating the cost per year of life saved, with\\nadjustment for the quality of life impact of different interventions and\\ndisease states (i.e., quality-adjusted life-year). Typically, strategies\\nthat cost $50,000–100,000 per quality-adjusted year of life saved are\\nconsidered “cost-effective” (Chap. 4).\\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is an\\nindependent panel of experts in preventive care that provides\\nevidence-based recommendations for screening and preventive\\nstrategies based on an assessment of the benefit-to-harm ratio\\n(Tables 6-4 and 6-5). Because there are multiple advisory\\norganizations providing recommendations for preventive services,\\nthe agreement among the organizations varies across the different\\nservices. For example, all advisory groups support screening for\\nhyperlipidemia and colorectal cancer, whereas consensus is lower\\nfor breast cancer screening among women in their forties and for\\nprostate cancer screening. Because the guidelines are only updated\\nperiodically, differences across advisory organizations may also\\nreflect the data that were available when the guideline was issued.\\nTABLE 6-4 Screening Tests Recommended by the U.S.\\nPreventive Services Task Force for Average-Risk Adults'),\n",

In\\naddition, being at increased risk for the disease often supports\\ninitiating screening at an earlier age than that recommended for the\\naverage-risk population. For example, when there is a significant\\nfamily history of colon cancer, it is prudent to initiate screening 10\\nyears before the age at which the youngest family member was\\ndiagnosed with cancer.\\nAlthough informed consent is important for all aspects of medical\\ncare, shared decision-making may be a particularly important\\napproach to decisions about preventive services when the benefit-to-\\nharm ratio is uncertain for a specific population. For example, many\\nexpert groups, including the American Cancer Society, recommend\\nan individualized discussion about prostate cancer screening,\\nbecause the decision-making process is complex and relies heavily\\non personal issues. Some men may decline screening, whereas\\nothers may be more willing to accept the risks of an early detection\\nstrategy. Recent analysis suggests that many men may be better off\\nnot screening for prostate cancer because watchful waiting was the\\npreferred strategy when quality-adjusted life-years were considered.\\nAnother example of shared decision-making involves the choice of\\ntechniques for colon cancer screening (Chap. 70). In controlled\\nstudies, the use of annual FOBT reduces colon cancer deaths by\\n15–30%. Flexible sigmoidoscopy reduces colon cancer deaths by\\n∼ 40–60%. Colonoscopy appears to offer a greater benefit than\\nflexible sigmoidoscopy with a reduction in risk of ∼ 70%, but its use\\nincurs additional costs and risks. These screening procedures have\\nnot been compared directly in the same population, but models\\nsuggest that appropriate frequencies of each technique may be\\nassociated with similar numbers of lives saved and cost to society\\nper life saved ($10,000–25,000). Thus, although one patient may\\nprefer the ease of preparation, less time disruption, and the lower\\nrisk of flexible sigmoidoscopy, others may prefer the sedation,\\nthoroughness, and time interval of colonoscopy.\\n■ COUNSELING ON HEALTHY BEHAVIORS'),\n",

The public is—with good justification—\\ndemanding measurement and accountability, and payment for\\nservices will increasingly be based on performance in these areas.\\nThus, physicians must learn about these two domains, how they can\\nbe improved, and the relative strengths and limitations of the current\\nability to measure them.\\nSafety and quality are closely related but do not completely\\noverlap. The Institute of Medicine has suggested in a seminal series\\nof reports that safety is the first part of quality and that the health\\ncare system must first and foremost guarantee that it will deliver safe\\ncare, although quality is also pivotal. In the end, it is likely that more\\nnet clinical benefit will be derived from improving quality than from\\nimproving safety, though both are important and safety is in many\\nways more tangible to the public.

Think of driving home\\nfrom the hospital: you intend to stop and pick up a quart of milk on\\nthe way home but find yourself entering your driveway without\\nrealizing how you got there. Everybody uses low-level,\\nsemiautomatic behavior for many activities in daily life; this kind of\\nerror is called a slip. Slips occur often during care delivery—e.g.,\\nwhen people intend to write an order but forget because they must\\ncomplete another action first. Mistakes, by contrast, are errors of a\\nhigher level; they occur in new or nonstereotypic situations in which'),\n",

An example would be dosing\\nof a medication with which a physician is not familiar. The strategies\\nused to prevent slips and mistakes are often different.\\nSystems theory suggests that most accidents occur as the result\\nof a series of small failures that happen to line up in an individual\\ninstance so that an accident can occur (Fig. 8-1). It also suggests\\nthat most individuals in an industry such as health care are trying to\\ndo the right thing (e.g., deliver safe care) and that most accidents\\nthus result from defects in systems. Systems should be designed\\nboth to make errors less likely and to identify those that do inevitably\\noccur.\\nFIGURE 8-1 “Swiss cheese” diagram. Reason argues that most accidents occur\\nwhen a series of “latent failures” are present in a system and happen to line up in a\\ngiven instance, resulting in an accident. Examples of latent failures in the case of a\\nfall might be that the unit is unusually busy and the floor happens to be wet.\\n(Adapted from J Reason: BMJ 320:768, 2000.)\\nFactors That Increase the Likelihood of Errors Many factors\\nubiquitous in health care systems can increase the likelihood of\\nerrors, including fatigue, stress, interruptions, complexity, and\\ntransitions. The effects of fatigue in other industries are clear, but its\\neffects in health care have been more controversial until recently.

A recent study of house officers in\\nthe intensive care unit demonstrated that they were about one-third\\nmore likely to make errors when they were on a 24-h shift than when\\nthey were on a schedule that allowed them to sleep 8 h the previous\\nnight. The American College of Graduate Medical Education has\\nmoved to address this issue by putting in place the 80-h workweek.\\nAlthough this stipulation is a step forward, it does not address the\\nmost important cause of fatigue-related errors: extended-duty shifts.\\nHigh levels of stress and heavy workloads also can increase error\\nrates. Thus, in extremely high-pressure situations, such as cardiac\\narrests, errors are more likely to occur. Strategies such as using\\nprotocols in these settings can be helpful, as can simple recognition\\nthat the situation is stressful.\\nInterruptions also increase the likelihood of error and occur\\nfrequently in health care delivery. It is common to forget to complete\\nan action when one is interrupted partway through it by a page, for\\nexample. Approaches that may be helpful in this area include\\nminimizing interruptions and setting up tools that help define the\\nurgency of an interruption.\\nComplexity represents a key issue that contributes to errors.\\nProviders are confronted by streams of data (e.g., laboratory tests\\nand vital signs), many of which provide little useful information but\\nsome of which are important and require action or suggest a specific\\ndiagnosis. Tools that emphasize specific abnormalities or\\ncombinations of abnormalities may be helpful in this area.\\nTransitions between providers and settings are also common in\\nhealth care, especially with the advent of the 80-h workweek, and\\ngenerally represent points of vulnerability. Tools that provide\\nstructure in exchanging information—for example, when transferring\\ncare between providers—may be helpful.\\nThe Frequency of Adverse Events in Health Care Most large\\nstudies focusing on the frequency and consequences of adverse\\nevents have been performed in the inpatient setting; some data are\\navailable for nursing homes, but much less information is available\\nabout the outpatient setting.

Rates of safety issues\\nappear to be even higher in developing and transitional countries;\\nthus, this is clearly an issue of global proportions.\\nIn the Harvard Medical Practice Study, adverse drug events\\n(ADEs) were most common, accounting for 19% of all adverse\\nevents, and were followed in frequency by wound infections (14%)\\nand technical complications (13%). Almost half of adverse events\\nwere associated with a surgical procedure.

Detection approaches in the research setting include chart\\nreview and the use of a computerized ADE monitor, a tool that\\nexplores the database and identifies signals that suggest an ADE\\nmay have occurred.

As of 2019, over 95% of U.S. hospitals had\\nimplemented CPOE, although the decision support often is still\\nlimited.\\nAnother technology that can improve medication safety is bar\\ncoding linked with an electronic medication administration record.\\nBar coding can help ensure that the right patient gets the right\\nmedication at the right time. Electronic medication administration\\nrecords can make it much easier to determine what medications a\\npatient has received.

The National Quality Forum\\nhas released recommendations to U.S. hospitals about what\\npractices will most improve the safety of care, and all hospitals are\\nexpected to implement these recommendations. Many of these\\npractices arise frequently in routine care.

Structure refers to whether a particular characteristic is\\napplicable in a particular setting—e.g., whether a hospital has a\\ncatheterization laboratory or whether a clinic uses an electronic\\nhealth record. Process refers to the way care is delivered; examples\\nof process measures are whether a Pap smear was performed at the\\nrecommended interval or whether an aspirin was given to a patient\\nwith a suspected myocardial infarction. Outcome refers to what\\nhappens—e.g., the mortality rate in myocardial infarction. It is\\nimportant to note that good structure and process do not always\\nresult in a good outcome.

Education is effective in the short run and is\\nnecessary for changing opinions, but its effect decays fairly rapidly\\nwith time. Feedback on performance can be given at either the group\\nor the individual level. Feedback is most effective if it is\\nindividualized and is given in close temporal proximity to the original\\nevents. Incentives can be effective, and many believe that they will\\nprove to be a key to improving quality, especially if pay-for-\\nperformance with sufficient incentives is broadly implemented (see\\nbelow). Penalties produce provider resentment and are rarely used\\nin health care.\\nAnother set of strategies for improving quality involves changing\\nthe systems of care. An example would be introducing reminders\\nabout which specific actions need to be taken at a visit for a specific\\npatient—a strategy that has been demonstrated to improve\\nperformance in certain situations, such as the delivery of preventive\\nservices.

From the earliest moments of medical school,\\nthe defining quest toward becoming a knowledgeable and proficient\\nphysician is learning how to put a diagnostic label on patients’\\nsymptoms and physical findings, and clinicians pride themselves on\\nbeing “good diagnosticians.” Yet the centuries-old paradigm of\\nmastering a long list of diseases, understanding their\\npathophysiology, and knowing the cardinal ways they manifest\\nthemselves in signs and symptoms, while still of fundamental\\nimportance, is being challenged by new insights illuminated by the\\nglaring spotlight of diagnostic errors. Basic internal medicine\\ndiseases, such as asthma, pulmonary embolism, congestive heart\\nfailure, seizures, strokes, ruptured aneurysms, depression, and\\ncancer, are misdiagnosed at shockingly high rates, often with 20–\\n50% of patients either being mislabeled as having these conditions\\n(false-positive diagnoses) or having their diagnosis missed or\\ndelayed (false negatives). How and why do physicians so often get it\\nwrong, and what can we do to both diagnose and treat the problem\\nof delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis?\\nDiagnosis is both an ancient art and a modern science. The\\ncurrent science of diagnosis, however, goes far beyond what\\ntypically comes to clinicians’ and patients’ minds when they conjure\\nup images of state-of-the-art molecular, genetic, or imaging\\ntechnologies.

Reports from patient surveys, malpractice claims,\\nand safety organizations, such as the ECRI and the National Patient\\nSafety Foundation (now part of Institute for Healthcare\\nImprovement), have found that diagnostic errors are the leading type\\nof medical error. Although errors in diagnosis are defined in various\\nways, the NAM Committee defined diagnostic error as “the failure to\\n(a) establish an accurate and timely explanation of the patient’s\\nhealth problem(s) or (b) communicate that explanation to the\\npatient.” One way to visualize diagnostic errors is through a Venn\\ndiagram (Fig. 9-1), which illustrates the fact that many things can go\\nwrong in the diagnostic process (e.g., failure to ask an important\\nhistory question, physical examination sign overlooked, laboratory\\nspecimen erroneously switched between two patients, x-ray not'),\n",

Betancourt\\nOver the course of its history, the United States has experienced\\ndramatic improvements in overall health and life expectancy, largely\\nas a result of initiatives in public health, health promotion, disease\\nprevention, and chronic care management. Our ability to prevent,\\ndetect, and treat diseases in their early stages has allowed us to\\ntarget and reduce rates of morbidity and mortality. Despite\\ninterventions that have improved the overall health of the majority of\\nAmericans, racial and ethnic minorities (blacks, Hispanics/Latinos,\\nNative Americans/Alaskan Natives, Asian/Pacific Islanders) have\\nbenefited less from these advances than whites and have suffered\\npoorer health outcomes from many major diseases, including\\ncardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. These disparities\\nhighlight the importance of recognizing and addressing the multiple\\nfactors that impact health outcomes, including structural racism,\\nsocial determinants of health (SDOH), access to care, and health\\ncare quality. On this last point, research has revealed that minorities\\nmay receive less care and lower-quality care than whites, even when\\nconfounders such as stage of presentation, comorbidities, and health\\ninsurance are controlled. These differences in quality are called\\nracial and ethnic disparities in health care. These health care\\ndisparities have taken on greater importance with the significant\\ntransformation of the U.S. health care system and value-based\\npurchasing. The shift toward creating financial incentives and\\ndisincentives to achieve quality goals makes focusing on those who\\nreceive lower-quality care more important than ever before. This\\nchapter will provide an overview of racial and ethnic disparities in\\nhealth and health care, identify root causes, and provide key\\nrecommendations to address these disparities at both the clinical\\nand health system levels.\\n■ NATURE AND EXTENT OF DISPARITIES'),\n",

It is now well accepted that race is a social category\\nwithout biologic foundation and a product of historical racism.\\nNevertheless, it is clear that racism has a biologic impact as a form\\nof psychosocial stress. It is now well established that psychosocial\\nstress negatively impacts health through psychophysiologic reactivity'),\n",

Structural\\nracism refers to the totality of ways that a society fosters, sustains,\\nand reinforces discrimination through sociopolitical, legal, economic,\\nand health structures that determine differential access to risks,\\nopportunities, and resources that drive health and health care\\ndisparities. Structural racism explains how racism’s structure and\\nideology can persist in governmental and institutional policies in the\\nabsence of individual actors who are explicitly racially prejudiced.\\nFor example, the history of residential segregation has had lasting\\nnegative effects generationally on equal access for racial/ethnic\\nminorities to employment, banking, earnings, high-quality education,\\nand health care. Policies that do not address root structural causes\\nwill not address health and health care inequities.\\nWith the promise of individualizing clinical decisions, the use of\\nrace in clinical and risk assessment algorithms has long been a part\\nof modern medicine. The evidence is now clear that race is not a\\nreliable proxy for genetic difference and that race adjustment has the\\npotential to create inadvertent disparities in health care. One clinical\\nexample is from nephrology. Blacks have higher rates of end-stage\\nkidney disease and death due to kidney failure than the overall\\npopulation. The most widely used cohort-derived equation to\\nestimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the Chronic Kidney Disease\\nEpidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation, has the limitation\\nthat it produces 80–90% estimated GFR (eGFR) values that are\\nwithin ±30% of a patient’s measured GFR. In addition, this equation'),\n",

The increase in eGFR is likely\\nto disadvantage blacks for early referral to a nephrologist, early\\ntreatment of advanced chronic kidney disease, and kidney\\ntransplantation. It is also not clear how to apply the race factor when\\nthe patient’s race is unknown and/or ambiguous, as in those who are\\nmultiracial. This disparity-inducing scenario could be avoided\\nthrough the use of cystatin C–based eGFR estimation, which has\\nbeen demonstrated to be more accurate than the CKD-EPI equation\\nand for which race is not required in estimation.\\nThe application of artificial intelligence (AI) analytics to large\\namounts of clinical electronic data—big data—holds the promise to\\nbetter understand health care costs, utilization, resource allocation,\\nand population health monitoring. Machine learning models can\\nidentify the statistical patterns in large amounts of historically\\ncollected data. These data naturally contain the patterning of\\npreexisting health care disparities created by socially and historically\\nstructured inequities. This biased patterning can lead to incorrect\\npredictions, withholding of resources, and worse outcomes for\\nvulnerable populations. Recently, analysis of a commercial, national,\\nproprietary prediction algorithm, affecting millions of patients,\\nexhibited racial bias. Historical cost data were used to predict clinical\\nrisk and allocate additional clinical services for high-cost patients.\\nAlgorithmic bias arose because black patients historically have less\\naccess to health care and thus less money is spent on their care\\ncompared to white patients. Thus, blacks, who tended to be sicker\\nthan white patients, received lower clinical risk scores and thus were\\nless likely to receive additional clinical services. The observed\\nallocation bias was remedied using direct measures of illness and\\nillness severity. Thus, machine learning algorithms are not inherently\\nfree of bias and should be assessed for accuracy and fairness.\\nIn summary, there are many ways in which racism has\\ncontributed and does and will continue to contribute to racial and\\nethnic disparities in health and health care.\\n■ SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH'),\n",

Communication issues related to\\ndiscordant language disproportionately affect minorities and likely\\ncontribute to racial/ethnic disparities in health care.\\nCLINICAL DECISION-MAKING Theory and research suggest that\\nvariations in clinical decision-making may contribute to racial and\\nethnic disparities in health care. Two factors are central to this\\nprocess: clinical uncertainty and stereotyping.\\nFirst, a doctor’s decision-making process is nested in clinical\\nuncertainty. Doctors depend on inferences about severity based on\\nwhat they understand about illness and the information obtained\\nfrom the patient. A doctor caring for a patient whose symptoms he or\\nshe has difficulty understanding and whose “signals”—the set of\\nclues and indications that physicians rely on to make clinical\\ndecisions—are hard to read may make a decision different from the\\none that would be made for another patient who presents with\\nexactly the same clinical condition. Given that the expression of\\nsymptoms may differ among cultural and racial groups, doctors—the\\noverwhelming majority of whom are white—may understand\\nsymptoms best when expressed by patients of their own racial/ethnic\\ngroups. The consequence is that white patients may be treated\\ndifferently from minority patients. Differences in clinical decisions can\\narise from this mechanism even when the doctor has the same\\nregard for each patient (i.e., is not prejudiced).\\nSecond, the literature on social cognitive theory highlights how\\nnatural tendencies to stereotype may influence clinical decision-\\nmaking. Stereotyping can be defined as the way in which people use\\nsocial categories (e.g., race, gender, age) in acquiring, processing,\\nand recalling information about others. Faced with enormous\\ninformation loads and the need to make many decisions, people\\noften subconsciously simplify the decision-making process and\\nlessen cognitive effort by using “categories” or “stereotypes” that\\nbundle information into groups or types that can be processed more\\nquickly. Although functional, stereotyping can be systematically\\nbiased, as people are automatically classified into social categories\\nbased on dimensions such as race, gender, and age.

For instance, if\\nthe media and our social/professional contacts tend to present\\nimages of minorities as being less educated, more violent, and\\nnonadherent to health care recommendations, these impressions\\nmay generate stereotypes that unnaturally and unjustly impact\\nclinical decision-making. As signs of racism, classism, gender bias,\\nand ageism are experienced (consciously or unconsciously) in our\\nsociety, stereotypes may be created that impact the way doctors\\nmanage patients from these groups. On the basis of training or\\npractice location, doctors may develop certain perceptions about\\nrace/ethnicity, culture, and class that may evolve into stereotypes.\\nFor example, many medical students and residents are trained—and\\nminorities cared for—in academic health centers or public hospitals\\nlocated in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas. As a result,\\ndoctors may begin to equate certain races and ethnicities with\\nspecific health beliefs and behaviors (e.g., “these patients” engage in\\nrisky behaviors, “those patients” tend to be noncompliant) that are\\nmore associated with the social environment (e.g., poverty) than with\\na patient’s racial/ethnic background or cultural traditions. This\\n“conditioning” phenomenon may also be operative if doctors are\\nfaced with certain racial/ethnic patient groups who frequently do not\\nchoose aggressive forms of diagnostic or therapeutic intervention.\\nThe result over time may be that doctors begin to believe that “these\\npatients” do not like invasive procedures; thus, they may not offer\\nthese procedures as options. A wide range of studies have\\ndocumented the potential for provider biases to contribute to\\nracial/ethnic disparities in health care. For example, one study\\nmeasured physicians’ unconscious (or implicit) biases and showed\\nthat these were related to differences in decisions to provide\\nthrombolysis for a hypothetical black or white patient with a\\nmyocardial infarction.\\nIt is important to differentiate stereotyping from prejudice and\\ndiscrimination.

Since patients’ preferences\\ncan change, these documents must be reviewed periodically.\\nTYPES OF DOCUMENTS Advance care planning documents are of two\\nbroad types. The first includes living wills, also known as\\ninstructional directives; these are advisory documents that describe\\nthe types of decisions that should direct a patient’s care. Some are\\nmore specific, delineating different scenarios and interventions for\\nthe patient to choose from.

Less specific directives\\ncan be general statements, such as not wanting life-sustaining\\ninterventions, or forms that describe the values that should guide\\nspecific discussions about terminal care. The second type of\\nadvance directive allows the designation of a health care proxy\\n(sometimes also referred to as a durable attorney for health care), an\\nindividual selected by the patient to make decisions. The choice is\\nnot either/or; a combined directive that includes a living will and\\ndesignates a proxy is often used, and the directive should indicate\\nclearly whether the specified patient preferences or the proxy’s\\nchoice takes precedence if they conflict. Some states have begun to\\nput into practice a “Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment\\n(POLST)” directive, which builds on communication between\\nproviders and patients by including guidance for end-of-life care in a\\ncolor-coordinated form that follows the patient across treatment\\nsettings. The procedures for completing advance care planning\\ndocuments vary according to state law.\\nA potentially misleading distinction relates to statutory, as\\nopposed to advisory, documents. Statutory documents are drafted to\\nfulfill relevant state laws. Advisory documents are drafted to reflect\\nthe patient’s wishes.

Importantly, in 25 states, the laws state that the living will\\nis not valid if a woman is pregnant. All states except Alaska have\\nenacted durable power of attorney for health care laws that permit\\npatients to designate a proxy decision-maker with authority to\\nterminate life-sustaining treatments. Only in Alaska does the law\\nprohibit proxies from terminating life-sustaining treatments for\\npregnant women.\\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that patients have a\\nconstitutional right to decide any issues related to refusing or\\nterminating medical interventions, including life-sustaining\\ninterventions, and that mentally incompetent patients can exercise\\nthis right by providing “clear and convincing evidence” of their\\npreferences. Since advance care directives permit patients to\\nprovide such evidence, commentators agree that they are\\nconstitutionally protected. Most commentators believe that a state is\\nrequired to honor any clear advance care directive, regardless of\\nwhether it is written on an “official” form. Many states have enacted\\nlaws for the explicit purpose of honoring out-of-state directives.

It is a\\ndeep or colicky type of pain classically associated with pancreatitis,\\nmyocardial infarction, or tumor invasion of viscera. Neuropathic pain\\narises from disordered nerve signals. It is described by patients as\\nburning, electrical, or shock-like pain. Classic examples are post-\\nstroke pain, tumor invasion of the brachial plexus, and herpetic\\nneuralgia.\\nASSESSMENT Pain is a subjective experience. Depending on the\\npatient’s circumstances, perspective, and physiologic condition, the\\nsame physical lesion or disease state can produce different levels of\\nreported pain and need for pain relief.

For refractory cases, opioid\\nantagonists or other therapies, such as lubiprostone, should be\\nconsidered.\\nMethylnaltrexone is the best-studied opioid antagonist for use in\\nrefractory opioid-induced constipation. It reverses opioid-induced\\nconstipation by blocking peripheral opioid receptors, but not central\\nreceptors, for analgesia. In placebo-controlled trials, it has been\\nshown to cause laxation within 24 h of administration. As with the\\nuse of opioids, about a third of patients using methylnaltrexone\\nexperience nausea and vomiting, but unlike with opioid usage,\\ntolerance usually develops within a week. Therefore, when one is\\nbeginning opioids, an antiemetic such as metoclopramide or a\\nserotonin antagonist is often prescribed prophylactically and stopped\\nafter 1 week. Olanzapine has also been shown to have antinausea\\nproperties and can be effective in countering delirium or anxiety, with\\nthe advantage of some weight gain.\\nDrowsiness, a common side effect of opioids, also usually abates\\nwithin a week. For refractory or severe cases, pharmacologic\\ntherapy should be considered. The best-studied agents are the\\npsychostimulants dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate, and\\nmodafinil, although evidence regarding their efficacy is weak.\\nModafinil has the advantage of once-a-day dosing compared to\\nmethyphenidate’s twice daily dosing.\\nSeriously ill patients who require chronic pain relief rarely\\nbecome addicted.

If left untreated,\\nconstipation can cause substantial pain and vomiting and also is\\nassociated with confusion and delirium. Whenever opioids and other\\nmedications known to cause constipation are used, preemptive\\ntreatment for constipation should be instituted.\\nASSESSMENT Assessing constipation can be difficult because people\\ndescribe it differently. Four commonly used assessment scales are\\nthe Bristol Stool Form Scale, the Constipation Assessment Scale,\\nthe Constipation Visual Analogue Scale, and the Eton Scale Risk\\nAssessment for Constipation. The Bowel Function Index can be\\nused to quantify opioid-induced constipation. The physician should\\nestablish the patient’s previous bowel habits, as well as any changes\\nin subjective and objective qualities such as bloating or decreased\\nfrequency. Abdominal and rectal examinations should be performed\\nto exclude impaction or an acute abdomen. Radiographic\\nassessments beyond a simple flat plate of the abdomen in cases in\\nwhich obstruction is suspected are rarely necessary.\\nINTERVENTION Any measure to address constipation during end-of-\\nlife care should include interventions to reestablish comfortable\\nbowel habits and to relieve pain or discomfort. Although physical\\nactivity, adequate hydration, and dietary treatments with fiber can be\\nhelpful, each is limited in its effectiveness for most seriously ill\\npatients, and fiber may exacerbate problems in the setting of\\ndehydration or if impaired motility is the etiology.

Medical\\ntreatments for nausea are aimed at receptors at each of these sites:\\nthe GI tract contains mechanoreceptors, chemoreceptors, and 5-\\nhydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptors; the vestibular system\\nprobably contains histamine and acetylcholine receptors; and the\\nCTZ contains chemoreceptors, dopamine type 2 receptors, and 5-\\nHT3 receptors. An example of nausea that most likely is mediated by\\nthe cortex is anticipatory nausea before a dose of chemotherapy or\\nother noxious stimuli.\\nSpecific causes of nausea include metabolic changes (liver\\nfailure, uremia from renal failure, hypercalcemia), bowel obstruction,\\nconstipation, infection, GERD, vestibular disease, brain metastases,\\nmedications (including antibiotics, NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitors,\\nopioids, and chemotherapy), and radiation therapy. Anxiety can also\\ncontribute to nausea.\\nINTERVENTION Medical treatment of nausea is directed at the\\nanatomic and receptor-mediated cause revealed by a careful history\\nand physical examination.

When inflammation of\\nthe GI tract is suspected, glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone,\\nare an appropriate treatment. For nausea that follows chemotherapy\\nand radiation therapy, one of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists or\\nneurokinin-1 antagonists, such as aprepitant or fosaprepitant, is\\nrecommended.

In\\nanticipatory nausea, patients can benefit from nonpharmacologic\\ninterventions, such as biofeedback and hypnosis.

In addition to low caloric\\nintake, loss of muscle mass and changes in muscle enzymes may\\nplay an important role in fatigue during terminal illness. The\\nimportance of changes in the CNS, especially the reticular activating\\nsystem, have been hypothesized based on reports of fatigue in\\npatients receiving cranial radiation, experiencing depression, or\\nhaving chronic pain in the absence of cachexia or other physiologic\\nchanges. Finally, depression and other causes of psychological\\ndistress can contribute to fatigue.\\nASSESSMENT Like pain and dyspnea, fatigue is subjective, as it\\nrepresents a patient’s sense of tiredness and decreased capacity for\\nphysical work. Objective changes, even in body mass, may be\\nabsent. Consequently, assessment must rely on patient self-\\nreporting. Scales used to measure fatigue, such as the Edmonton\\nFunctional Assessment Tool, the Fatigue Self-Report Scales, and the\\nRhoten Fatigue Scale, are usually appropriate for research but not\\nclinical purposes. In clinical practice, a simple performance\\nassessment such as the Karnofsky performance status or the\\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)’s question “How\\nmuch of the day does the patient spend in bed?” may be the best\\nmeasure.

Delirium may occur in a\\npatient with dementia; indeed, patients with dementia are more\\nvulnerable to delirium.\\nCauses of delirium include metabolic encephalopathy arising\\nfrom liver or renal failure, hypoxemia, or infection; electrolyte\\nimbalances such as hypercalcemia; paraneoplastic syndromes;\\ndehydration; and primary brain tumors, brain metastases, or\\nleptomeningeal spread of tumor. Among dying patients, delirium is\\ncommonly caused by side effects of treatments, including radiation\\nfor brain metastases and medications, such as opioids,\\nglucocorticoids, anticholinergic drugs, antihistamines, antiemetics,\\nbenzodiazepines, and chemotherapeutic agents. The etiology may\\nbe multifactorial; e.g., dehydration may exacerbate opioid-induced\\ndelirium.\\nASSESSMENT Delirium should be recognized in any terminally ill\\npatient exhibiting new onset of disorientation, impaired cognition,\\nsomnolence, fluctuating levels of consciousness, or delusions with or\\nwithout agitation. Delirium must be distinguished from acute anxiety,\\ndepression, and dementia. The central distinguishing feature is\\naltered consciousness, which usually is not noted in anxiety,\\ndepression, or dementia. Although “hyperactive” delirium,\\ncharacterized by overt confusion and agitation, is probably more\\ncommon, patients should also be assessed for “hypoactive” delirium,\\nwhich is characterized by sleep-wake reversal and decreased\\nalertness.\\nIn some cases, use of formal assessment tools such as the Mini-\\nMental Status Examination (which does not distinguish delirium from\\ndementia) and the Delirium Rating Scale (which does distinguish\\ndelirium from dementia) may be helpful in distinguishing delirium\\nfrom other processes. The patient’s list of medications must be\\nevaluated carefully. Nonetheless, a reversible etiologic factor for\\ndelirium is found in fewer than half of all terminally ill patients.

Delirium, especially when in combination with\\nagitation during the final days, is distressing to family and caregivers.\\nA strong determinant of bereavement difficulties is witnessing a\\ndifficult death. Thus, terminal delirium should be treated\\naggressively.\\nAt the first sign of delirium, such as day-night reversal with slight\\nchanges in mentation, the physician should let the family members\\nknow that it is time to be sure that everything they want to say has\\nbeen said. The family should be informed that delirium is common\\njust before death.\\nIf medications are suspected of being a cause of the delirium,\\nunnecessary agents should be discontinued. Other potentially\\nreversible causes, such as constipation, urinary retention, and\\nmetabolic abnormalities, should be treated. Supportive measures\\naimed at providing a familiar environment should be instituted,\\nincluding restricting visits only to individuals with whom the patient is\\nfamiliar and eliminating new experiences; orienting the patient, if\\npossible, by providing a clock and calendar; and gently correcting\\nthe patient’s hallucinations or cognitive mistakes.\\nPharmacologic management focuses on the use of neuroleptics\\nand, in extreme cases, anesthetics (Table 12-7). Haloperidol\\nremains the first-line therapy. Usually, patients can be controlled with\\na low dose (1–3 mg/d), given every 6 h, although some may require\\nas much as 20 mg/d. Haloperidol can be administered PO, SC, or IV.\\nIM injections should not be used, except when this is the only way to\\naddress a patient’s delirium. Olanzapine, an atypical neuroleptic, has\\nshown significant effectiveness in completely resolving delirium in\\ncancer patients. It also has other beneficial effects for terminally ill\\npatients, including antinausea, antianxiety, and weight gain.\\nOlanzapine is useful for patients with longer anticipated life\\nexpectancies because it is less likely to cause dysphoria and has a\\nlower risk of dystonic reactions. Additionally, because olanzapine is'),\n",

Chlorpromazine (10–25 mg\\nevery 4–6 h) can be useful if sedation is desired and can be\\nadministered IV or PR in addition to PO. Dystonic reactions resulting\\nfrom dopamine blockade are a side effect of neuroleptics, although\\nthey are reported to be rare when these drugs are used to treat\\nterminal delirium. If patients develop dystonic reactions, benztropine\\nshould be administered.

This is known as financial toxicity. In the United States,\\nwhich has the least comprehensive health insurance systems among\\nwealthy countries, a quarter of families coping with end-stage cancer\\nreport that care was a major financial burden and a third used up\\nmost of their savings. Among Medicare beneficiaries, average out-of-\\npocket costs were >$8000. Between 10% and 30% of families are\\nforced to sell assets, use savings, or take out a mortgage to pay for\\nthe patient’s health care costs.\\nThe patient is likely to reduce hours worked and eventually stop\\nworking altogether. In 20% of cases, a family member of the\\nterminally ill patient also must stop working to provide care. The\\nmajor underlying causes of economic burden are related to poor\\nphysical functioning and care needs, such as the need for\\nhousekeeping, nursing, and personal care. More debilitated patients\\nand poor patients experience greater economic burdens.\\nINTERVENTION The economic burden of end-of-life care should not be\\nignored as a private matter. It has been associated with a number of\\nadverse health outcomes, including preferring comfort care over life-\\nprolonging care, as well as consideration of euthanasia or physician-\\nassisted suicide (PAS). Economic burdens increase the\\npsychological distress of the families and caregivers of terminally ill'),\n",

Importantly, studies have found that “patients with\\nadvanced cancer who reported having end-of-life conversations with\\nphysicians had significantly lower health care costs in their final\\nweek of life. Higher costs were associated with worse quality of\\ndeath.” Assistance from a social worker, early on if possible, to\\nensure access to all available benefits may be helpful. Many\\npatients, families, and health care providers are unaware of options\\nfor long-term care insurance, respite care, the Family Medical Leave\\nAct (FMLA), and other sources of assistance. Some of these options\\n(such as respite care) may be part of a formal hospice program, but\\nothers (such as the FMLA) do not require enrollment in a hospice\\nprogram.\\nRelationships • FREQUENCY Settling personal issues and closing\\nthe narrative of lived relationships are universal needs. When asked\\nif sudden death or death after an illness is preferable, respondents\\noften initially select the former, but soon change to the latter as they\\nreflect on the importance of saying goodbye. Bereaved family\\nmembers who have not had the chance to say goodbye often have a\\nmore difficult grief process.\\nINTERVENTIONS Care of seriously ill patients requires efforts to\\nfacilitate the types of encounters and time spent with family and\\nfriends that are necessary to meet those needs. Family and close\\nfriends may need to be accommodated in hospitals and other\\nfacilities with unrestricted visiting hours, which may include sleeping\\nnear the patient, even in otherwise regimented institutional settings.\\nPhysicians and other health care providers may be able to facilitate\\nand resolve strained interactions between the patient and other\\nfamily members. Assistance for patients and family members who\\nare unsure about how to create or help preserve memories, whether\\nby providing materials such as a scrapbook or memory box or by\\noffering them suggestions and informational resources, can be\\ndeeply appreciated.

       " Document(metadata={'source': \"data/Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine.pdf\"}, page_content='Family Caregivers • FREQUENCY Caring for seriously ill patients\\nplaces a heavy burden on families. Families are frequently required\\nto provide transportation and homemaking, as well as other services.\\nTypically, paid professionals, such as home health nurses and\\nhospice workers, supplement family care; only about a quarter of all\\ncaregiving consists of exclusively paid professional assistance. Over\\nthe past 40 years, there has been a significant decline in the United\\nStates of deaths occurring in hospitals, with a simultaneous increase\\nin deaths in other facilities and at home. Over a third of deaths occur\\nin patients’ homes. This increase in out-of-hospital deaths increases\\nreliance on families for end-of-life care. Increasingly, family members\\nare being called upon to provide physical care (such as moving and\\nbathing patients) and medical care (such as assessing symptoms\\nand giving medications) in addition to emotional care and support.\\nThree-quarters of family caregivers of terminally ill patients are\\nwomen—wives, daughters, sisters, and even daughters-in-law. Since\\nmany are widowed, women tend to be able to rely less on family for\\ncaregiving assistance and may need more paid assistance. About\\n20% of terminally ill patients report substantial unmet needs for\\nnursing and personal care. The impact of caregiving on family\\ncaregivers is substantial: both bereaved and current caregivers have\\na higher mortality rate than that of non-caregiving controls.\\nINTERVENTIONS It is imperative to inquire about unmet needs and to\\ntry to ensure that those needs are met either through the family or by\\npaid professional services when possible. Community assistance\\nthrough houses of worship or other community groups often can be\\nmobilized by telephone calls from the medical team to someone the\\npatient or family identifies. Sources of support specifically for family\\ncaregivers should be identified through local sources or nationally\\nthrough groups such as the National Family Caregivers Association\\n(www.nfcacares.org), the American Cancer Society\\n(www.cancer.org), and the Alzheimer’s Association (www.alz.org).\\n■ EXISTENTIAL NEEDS AND THEIR MANAGEMENT\\nFrequency Religion and spirituality are often important to dying\\npatients.

When asked,\\npatients and family caregivers frequently report wanting their\\nprofessional caregivers to be more attentive to religion and\\nspirituality.\\nAssessment Health care providers are often hesitant about\\ninvolving themselves in the religious, spiritual, and existential\\nexperiences of their patients because it may seem private or not\\nrelevant to the current illness. But physicians and other members of\\nthe care team should be able at least to detect spiritual and\\nexistential needs. Screening questions have been developed for a\\nphysician’s spiritual history taking. Spiritual distress can amplify\\nother types of suffering and even masquerade as intractable physical\\npain, anxiety, or depression.

Hospice is a leading, but not the only, model of\\npalliative care services. In the United States, slightly more than a\\nthird—35.7%—of hospice care is provided in private residential\\nhomes with 14.5% of hospice care in nursing homes. In the United\\nStates, Medicare pays for hospice services under Part A, the\\nhospital insurance part of reimbursement. Two physicians must\\ncertify that the patient has a prognosis of ≤6 months if the disease\\nruns its usual course. Prognoses are probabilistic by their nature;\\npatients are not required to die within 6 months but rather to have a\\ncondition from which half the individuals with it would not be alive\\nwithin 6 months. Patients sign a hospice enrollment form that states\\ntheir intent to forgo curative services related to their terminal illness\\nbut can still receive medical services for other comorbid conditions.\\nPatients also can withdraw enrollment and reenroll later; the hospice\\nMedicare benefit can be revoked later to secure traditional Medicare\\nbenefits. Payments to the hospice are per diem (or capitated), not\\nfee-for-service. Payments are intended to cover physician services\\nfor the medical direction of the care team; regular home care visits\\nby registered nurses and licensed practical nurses; home health aide\\nand homemaker services; chaplain services; social work services;\\nbereavement counseling; and medical equipment, supplies, and\\nmedications. No specific therapy is excluded, and the goal is for\\neach therapy to be considered for its symptomatic (as opposed to\\ndisease-modifying) effect. Additional clinical care, including services\\nof the primary physician, is covered by Medicare Part B even while\\nthe hospice Medicare benefit is in place.\\nThe Affordable Care Act directs the secretary of Health and\\nHuman Services to gather data on Medicare hospice reimbursement'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': \"data/Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine.pdf\"}, page_content='with the goal of reforming payment rates to account for resource use\\nover an entire episode of care. The legislation also requires\\nadditional evaluations and reviews of eligibility for hospice care by\\nhospice physicians or nurses. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid\\nInnovation (CMMI) sponsors and carries out demonstration projects\\nto test models and evaluate the potential of new methods. In 2016,\\nCMMI started a 5-year test of concurrent hospice and palliative care\\nservices with curative treatment for terminally ill patients who have a\\nlife expectancy of ≤6 months. A 4-year test initiated in 2021 will\\nexamine the inclusion of hospice in Medicare Advantage covering\\n8% of the market and include important health plans.\\nBy 2018, the average length of enrollment in a hospice for\\nMedicare beneficiaries was 90 days. However, the median length of\\nstay was just 18 days, suggesting most patients are in hospice for a\\nshort time. Such short stays create barriers to establishing high-\\nquality palliative services in patients’ homes and also place financial\\nstrains on hospice providers since the initial assessments are\\nresource intensive. Physicians should initiate early referrals to the\\nhospice to allow more time for patients to receive palliative care.\\nIn the United States, hospice care has been the main method for\\nsecuring palliative services for terminally ill patients. However,\\nleading physicians have increasingly emphasized the need to\\nintroduce palliative care much earlier in patients’ illness, and efforts\\nare being made to develop palliative care services that can be\\nprovided before the last 6 months of life and across a variety of\\nsettings. Studies of terminally ill patients indicate that those who\\nreceived in-home palliative care delivered by an interdisciplinary\\nteam compared to usual care were more satisfied, more likely to die\\nat home, and had fewer visits to the emergency room and lower per-\\nday costs. More companies and home health agencies are now\\noffering nonhospice palliative care services in patients’ homes in an\\neffort to increase quality of life and forestall emergency room visits\\nand hospitalizations. Similarly, palliative care services are\\nincreasingly available via consultation, rather than being available\\nonly in hospital, day care, outpatient, and nursing home settings.\\nPalliative care consultations for nonhospice patients can be billed as\\nfor other consultations under Medicare Part B.

The current legal\\nconsensus in the United States and most wealthy countries is that\\npatients have a moral as well as legal right to refuse medical\\ninterventions. American courts also have held that incompetent\\npatients have a right to refuse medical interventions. For patients\\nwho are incompetent and terminally ill and who have not completed\\nan advance care directive, next of kin can exercise that right,\\nalthough this may be restricted in some states, depending on how\\nclear and convincing the evidence is of the patient’s preferences.\\nCourts have limited families’ ability to terminate life-sustaining\\ntreatments in patients who are conscious and incompetent but not\\nterminally ill. In theory, patients’ right to refuse medical therapy can\\nbe limited by four countervailing interests: (1) preservation of life, (2)\\nprevention of suicide, (3) protection of third parties such as children,\\nand (4) preservation of the integrity of the medical profession. In\\npractice, these interests almost never override the right of competent\\npatients and incompetent patients who have left explicit wishes or\\nadvance care directives.\\nFor incompetent patients who either appointed a proxy without\\nspecific indications of their wishes or never completed an advance\\ncare directive, three criteria have been suggested to guide the\\ndecision to terminate medical interventions. First, some\\ncommentators suggest that ordinary care should be administered but\\nextraordinary care could be terminated. Because the\\nordinary/extraordinary distinction is too vague, courts and\\ncommentators widely agree that it should not be used to justify\\ndecisions about stopping treatment. Second, many courts have\\nadvocated the use of the substituted-judgment criterion, which holds\\nthat the proxy decision-makers should try to imagine what the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': \"data/Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine.pdf\"}, page_content='incompetent patient would do if he or she were competent. However,\\nmultiple studies indicate that many proxies, even close family\\nmembers, cannot accurately predict what the patient would have\\nwanted. Therefore, substituted judgment becomes more of a\\nguessing game than a way of fulfilling the patient’s wishes. Finally,\\nthe best-interests criterion holds that proxies should evaluate\\ntreatments by balancing their benefits and risks and select those\\ntreatments where the benefits maximally outweigh the burdens of\\ntreatment. Clinicians have a clear and crucial role in this by carefully\\nand dispassionately explaining the known benefits and burdens of\\nspecific treatments. Yet even when that information is as clear as\\npossible, different individuals can have very different views of what is\\nin the patient’s best interests, and families may have disagreements\\nor even overt conflicts. This criterion has been criticized because\\nthere is no single way to determine the balance between benefits\\nand burdens; it depends on a patient’s personal values. For\\ninstance, for some people, being alive even if mentally incapacitated\\nis a benefit, whereas for others, it may be the worst possible\\nexistence. As a matter of practice, physicians rely on family\\nmembers to make decisions that they feel are best and object only if\\nthose decisions seem to demand treatments that the physicians\\nconsider not beneficial.\\nPractices Withholding and withdrawing acutely life-sustaining\\nmedical interventions from terminally ill patients are now standard\\npractice. More than 90% of American patients die without\\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and just as many forgo other\\npotentially life-sustaining interventions. For instance, in ICUs in the\\nperiod of 1987–1988, CPR was performed 49% of the time, but it\\nwas performed only 10% of the time in 1992–1993 and on just 1.8%\\nof admissions from 2001 to 2008. On average, 3.8 interventions,\\nsuch as vasopressors and transfusions, were stopped for each dying\\nICU patient. However, up to 19% of decedents in hospitals received\\ninterventions such as extubation, ventilation, and surgery in the 48 h\\npreceding death. There is wide variation in practices among\\nhospitals and ICUs, suggesting an important element of physician'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': \"data/Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine.pdf\"}, page_content='preferences rather than consistent adherence to professional society\\nrecommendations.\\nMechanical ventilation may be the most challenging intervention\\nto withdraw. The two approaches are terminal extubation, which is\\nthe removal of the endotracheal tube, and terminal weaning, which is\\nthe gradual reduction of the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) or\\nventilator rate. One-third of ICU physicians prefer to use the terminal\\nweaning technique, and 13% extubate; the majority of physicians\\nutilize both techniques. The American Thoracic Society’s 2008\\nclinical policy guidelines note that there is no single correct process\\nof ventilator withdrawal and that physicians use and should be\\nproficient in both methods but that the chosen approach should\\ncarefully balance benefits and burdens as well as patient and\\ncaregiver preferences. Some recommend terminal weaning because\\npatients do not develop upper airway obstruction and the distress\\ncaused by secretions or stridor; however, terminal weaning can\\nprolong the dying process and not allow a patient’s family to be with\\nthe patient unencumbered by an endotracheal tube. To ensure\\ncomfort for conscious or semiconscious patients before withdrawal of\\nthe ventilator, neuromuscular blocking agents should be terminated\\nand sedatives and analgesics administered. Removing the\\nneuromuscular blocking agents permits patients to show discomfort,\\nfacilitating the titration of sedatives and analgesics; it also permits\\ninteractions between patients and their families. A common practice\\nis to inject a bolus of midazolam (2–4 mg) or lorazepam (2–4 mg)\\nbefore withdrawal, followed by a bolus of 5–10 mg of morphine and\\ncontinuous infusion of morphine (50% of the bolus dose per hour)\\nduring weaning. In patients who have significant upper airway\\nsecretions, IV scopolamine at a rate of 100 μg/h can be\\nadministered. Additional boluses of morphine or increases in the\\ninfusion rate should be administered for respiratory distress or signs\\nof pain. Higher doses will be needed for patients already receiving\\nsedatives and opioids.\\nThe median time to death after stopping of the ventilator is 1 h.\\nHowever, up to 10% of patients unexpectedly survive for 1 day or\\nmore after mechanical ventilation is stopped.

Although no objective definition or\\nstandard of futility exists, several categories have been proposed.\\nPhysiologic futility means that an intervention will have no\\nphysiologic effect. Some have defined qualitative futility as applying\\nto procedures that “fail to end a patient’s total dependence on\\nintensive medical care.” Quantitative futility occurs “when physicians\\nconclude (through personal experience, experiences shared with\\ncolleagues, or consideration of reported empiric data) that in the last\\n100 cases, a medical treatment has been useless.” The term\\nconceals subjective value judgments about when a treatment is “not\\nbeneficial.” Deciding whether a treatment that obtains an additional 6\\nweeks of life or a 1% survival advantage confers benefit depends on\\npatients’ preferences and goals. Furthermore, physicians’ predictions\\nof when treatments are futile deviate markedly from the quantitative\\ndefinition. When residents thought CPR was quantitatively futile,\\nmore than one in five patients had a >10% chance of survival to\\nhospital discharge. Most studies that purport to guide determinations\\nof futility are based on insufficient data and therefore cannot provide\\nstatistical confidence for clinical decision-making. Quantitative futility\\nrarely applies in ICU settings.\\nMany commentators reject using futility as a criterion for\\nwithdrawing care, preferring instead to consider futility situations as\\nones that represent conflict that calls for careful negotiation between\\nfamilies and health care providers. The American Medical\\nAssociation and other professional societies have developed\\nprocess-based approaches to resolving cases clinicians feel are\\nfutile. These process-based measures mainly suggest involving\\nconsultants and/or ethics committees when there are seemingly\\nirresolvable differences. Some hospitals have enacted “unilateral do-'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': \"data/Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine.pdf\"}, page_content='not-resuscitate” policies to allow clinicians to provide a do-not-\\nresuscitate order in cases in which consensus cannot be reached\\nwith families and medical opinion is that resuscitation would be futile\\nif attempted. This type of a policy is not a replacement for careful\\nand patient communication and negotiation but recognizes that\\nagreement cannot always be reached.\\nIn 1999, Texas enacted the so-called Futile Care Act. Other\\nstates, such as Virginia, Maryland, and California, have also enacted\\nsuch laws that provide physicians a “safe harbor” from liability if they\\nrefuse a patient’s or family’s request for life-sustaining interventions.\\nFor instance, in Texas, when a disagreement about terminating\\ninterventions between the medical team and the family has not been\\nresolved by an ethics consultation, the physician is tasked with trying\\nto facilitate transfer of the patient to an institution willing to provide\\ntreatment. If this fails after 10 days, the hospital and physician may\\nunilaterally withdraw treatments determined to be futile. The family\\nmay appeal to a state court. Early data suggest that the law\\nincreases futility consultations for the ethics committee and that,\\nalthough most families concur with withdrawal, ∼ 10–15% of families\\nrefuse to withdraw treatment. As of 2007, there had been 974 ethics\\ncommittee consultations on medical futility cases and 65 in which\\ncommittees ruled against families and gave notice that treatment\\nwould be terminated. In 2007, a survey of Texas hospitals showed\\nthat 30% of hospitals had used the futility law in 213 adult cases and\\n42 pediatric cases. Treatment was withdrawn for 27 of those\\npatients, and the remainder were transferred to other facilities or\\ndied while awaiting transfer.\\n■ EUTHANASIA AND PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE\\nEuthanasia and PAS are defined in Table 12-8. Terminating life-\\nsustaining care and providing opioid medications to manage\\nsymptoms such as pain or dyspnea have long been considered\\nethical by the medical profession and legal by courts and should not\\nbe conflated with euthanasia or PAS.\\nTABLE 12-8 Definitions of Physician-Assisted Suicide and\\nEuthanasia'),\n",

Fields\\nThe province of medicine is to preserve and restore health and to\\nrelieve suffering. Understanding pain is essential to both of these\\ngoals. Because pain is universally understood as a signal of disease,\\nit is the most common symptom that brings a patient to a physician’s\\nattention. The function of the pain sensory system is to protect the\\nbody and maintain homeostasis. It does this by detecting, localizing,\\nand identifying potential or actual tissue-damaging processes.\\nBecause different diseases produce characteristic patterns of tissue\\ndamage, the quality, time course, and location of a patient’s pain\\nlend important diagnostic clues. It is the physician’s responsibility to\\nassess each patient promptly for any remediable cause underlying\\nthe pain and to provide rapid and effective pain relief whenever\\npossible.\\nTHE PAIN SENSORY SYSTEM\\nPain is an unpleasant sensation localized to a part of the body. It is\\noften described in terms of a penetrating or tissue-destructive\\nprocess (e.g., stabbing, burning, twisting, tearing, squeezing) and/or\\nof a bodily or emotional reaction (e.g., terrifying, nauseating,\\nsickening). Furthermore, any pain of moderate or higher intensity is\\naccompanied by anxiety and the urge to escape or terminate the\\nfeeling. These properties illustrate the duality of pain: it is both\\nsensation and emotion. When it is acute, pain is characteristically\\nassociated with behavioral arousal and a stress response consisting\\nof increased blood pressure, heart rate, pupil diameter, and plasma\\ncortisol levels. In addition, local muscle contraction (e.g., limb flexion,\\nabdominal wall rigidity) is often present.\\n■ PERIPHERAL MECHANISMS'),\n",

The largest diameter afferent fibers, A-beta (Aβ), respond\\nmaximally to light touch and/or moving stimuli; they are present\\nprimarily in nerves that innervate the skin. In normal individuals, the\\nactivity of these fibers does not produce pain. There are two other\\nclasses of primary afferent nerve fibers: the small diameter\\nmyelinated A-delta (Aδ) and the unmyelinated (C) axons (Fig. 13-1).\\nThese fibers are present in nerves to the skin and to deep somatic\\nand visceral structures.

Primary afferents include those with large-diameter myelinated (Aβ),\\nsmall-diameter myelinated (Aδ), and unmyelinated (C) axons. All sympathetic\\npostganglionic fibers are unmyelinated.\\nIndividual primary afferent nociceptors can respond to several\\ndifferent types of noxious stimuli. For example, most nociceptors\\nrespond to heat; intense cold; intense mechanical distortion, such as\\na pinch; changes in pH, particularly an acidic environment; and\\napplication of chemical irritants including adenosine triphosphate\\n(ATP), serotonin, bradykinin (BK), and histamine. The transient\\nreceptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TrpV1),\\nalso known as the vanilloid receptor, mediates perception of some\\nnoxious stimuli, especially heat sensations, by nociceptive neurons;\\nit is activated by heat, acidic pH, endogenous mediators, and\\ncapsaicin, a component of hot chili peppers.\\nSensitization When intense, repeated, or prolonged stimuli are\\napplied to damaged or inflamed tissues, the threshold for activating\\nprimary afferent nociceptors is lowered, and the frequency of firing is\\nhigher for all stimulus intensities. Inflammatory mediators such as\\nBK, nerve-growth factor, some prostaglandins (PGs), and\\nleukotrienes contribute to this process, which is called sensitization.\\nSensitization occurs at the level of the peripheral nerve terminal\\n(peripheral sensitization) as well as at the level of the dorsal horn of\\nthe spinal cord (central sensitization). Peripheral sensitization occurs\\nin damaged or inflamed tissues, when inflammatory mediators\\nactivate intracellular signal transduction in nociceptors, prompting an\\nincrease in the production, transport, and membrane insertion of\\nchemically gated and voltage-gated ion channels. These changes\\nincrease the excitability of nociceptor terminals and lower their\\nthreshold for activation by mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli.\\nCentral sensitization occurs when activity, generated by nociceptors\\nduring inflammation, enhances the excitability of nerve cells in the\\ndorsal horn of the spinal cord.

A striking example of sensitization is\\nsunburned skin, in which severe pain can be produced by a gentle\\nslap or a warm shower.\\nSensitization is of particular importance for pain and tenderness\\nin deep tissues. Viscera are normally relatively insensitive to noxious\\nmechanical and thermal stimuli, although hollow viscera do generate\\nsignificant discomfort when distended. In contrast, when affected by\\na disease process with an inflammatory component, deep structures\\nsuch as joints or hollow viscera characteristically become exquisitely\\nsensitive to mechanical stimulation.\\nA large proportion of Aδ and C fiber afferents innervating viscera\\nare completely insensitive in normal noninjured, noninflamed tissue.\\nThat is, they cannot be activated by known mechanical or thermal\\nstimuli and are not spontaneously active.

The major neurotransmitter released is glutamate, which\\nrapidly excites the second-order dorsal horn neurons. Primary\\nafferent nociceptor terminals also release substance P and CGRP,\\nwhich produce a slower and longer-lasting excitation of the dorsal\\nhorn neurons.

These axons form the contralateral\\nspinothalamic tract, which lies in the anterolateral white matter of the\\nspinal cord, the lateral edge of the medulla, and the lateral pons and\\nmidbrain. The spinothalamic pathway is crucial for pain sensation in\\nhumans. Interruption of this pathway produces permanent deficits in\\npain and temperature discrimination.\\nSpinothalamic tract axons ascend to several regions of the\\nthalamus. There is tremendous divergence of the pain signal from\\nthese thalamic sites to several distinct areas of the cerebral cortex\\nthat subserve different aspects of the pain experience (Fig. 13-4).\\nOne of the thalamic projections is to the somatosensory cortex. This\\nprojection mediates the sensory discriminative aspects of pain, i.e.,\\nits location, intensity, and quality. Other thalamic neurons project to\\ncortical regions that are linked to emotional responses, such as the\\ncingulate and insular cortex. These pathways to the frontal cortex\\nsubserve the affective or unpleasant emotional dimension of pain.\\nThis affective dimension of pain produces suffering and exerts potent\\ncontrol of behavior. Because of this dimension, fear is a constant\\ncompanion of pain.

Opioid-induced\\nrespiratory depression is primarily manifest as a reduction in\\nrespiratory rate and is typically accompanied by sedation.

Unfortunately, this approach, while\\neffective, remains largely underused in current medical practice.\\nThere are several factors that can cause, perpetuate, or\\nexacerbate chronic pain.

Several general principles should guide therapy: the first is to\\nmove quickly to provide relief, and the second is to minimize drug\\nside effects. For example, in patients with postherpetic neuralgia\\nand significant cutaneous hypersensitivity, topical lidocaine\\n(Lidoderm patches) can provide immediate relief without side\\neffects. The anticonvulsants gabapentin or pregabalin (see above)\\nor antidepressants (nortriptyline, desipramine, duloxetine, or\\nvenlafaxine) can be used as first-line drugs for patients with\\nneuropathic pain. Systemically administered antiarrhythmic drugs\\nsuch as lidocaine and mexiletine are less likely to be effective.\\nAlthough intravenous infusion of lidocaine can provide analgesia for\\npatients with different types of neuropathic pain, the relief is usually\\ntransient, typically lasting just hours after the cessation of the\\ninfusion. The oral lidocaine congener mexiletine is poorly tolerated,\\nproducing frequent gastrointestinal adverse effects. There is no\\nconsensus on which class of drug should be used as a first-line\\ntreatment for any chronically painful condition. However, because\\nrelatively high doses of anticonvulsants are required for pain relief,\\nsedation is not uncommon. Sedation is also a problem with TCAs\\nbut is much less of a problem with serotonin/norepinephrine\\nreuptake inhibitors (SNRIs; e.g., venlafaxine and duloxetine). Thus,\\nin the elderly or in patients whose daily activities require high-level\\nmental activity, these drugs should be considered the first line. In\\ncontrast, opioid medications should be used as a second- or third-\\nline drug class. Although highly effective for many painful\\nconditions, opioids are sedating, and their effect tends to lessen\\nover time, leading to dose escalation and, occasionally, a worsening\\nof pain. A couple of interesting alternatives to pure opioids are two\\ndrugs with mixed opioid and norepinephrine reuptake action:\\ntramadol and tapentadol.

The most\\ncommon diagnoses are gastrointestinal causes (Fig. 14-1), and as\\nfew as 5% are other life-threatening cardiopulmonary conditions.

Myocardial ischemia is precipitated by an\\nimbalance between myocardial oxygen requirements and myocardial\\noxygen supply, resulting in insufficient delivery of oxygen to meet the\\nheart’s metabolic demands. Myocardial oxygen consumption may be\\nelevated by increases in heart rate, ventricular wall stress, and\\nmyocardial contractility, whereas myocardial oxygen supply is\\ndetermined by coronary blood flow and coronary arterial oxygen\\ncontent. When myocardial ischemia is sufficiently severe and\\nprolonged in duration (as little as 20 min), irreversible cellular injury\\noccurs, resulting in MI.\\nIschemic heart disease is most commonly caused by\\natheromatous plaque that obstructs one or more of the epicardial\\ncoronary arteries. Stable ischemic heart disease (Chap. 273) usually\\nresults from the gradual atherosclerotic narrowing of the coronary\\narteries. Stable angina is characterized by ischemic episodes that\\nare typically precipitated by a superimposed increase in oxygen\\ndemand during physical exertion and relieved upon resting. Ischemic\\nheart disease becomes unstable, manifest by ischemia at rest or\\nwith an escalating pattern, most commonly when rupture or erosion\\nof one or more atherosclerotic lesions triggers coronary thrombosis.\\nUnstable ischemic heart disease is further classified clinically by the\\npresence or absence of detectable acute myocardial injury and the\\npresence or absence of ST-segment elevation on the patient’s\\nelectrocardiogram (ECG). When acute coronary atherothrombosis\\noccurs, the intracoronary thrombus may be partially obstructive,\\ngenerally leading to myocardial ischemia in the absence of ST-\\nsegment elevation. Unstable ischemic heart disease is classified as\\nunstable angina when there is no detectable acute myocardial injury\\nand as non–ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) when there is evidence of\\nacute myocardial necrosis (Chap. 274). When the coronary\\nthrombus is acutely and completely occlusive, transmural myocardial\\nischemia usually ensues, with ST-segment elevation on the ECG\\nand myocardial necrosis leading to a diagnosis of ST elevation MI\\n(STEMI; see Chap. 275).'),\n",

In order to guide therapeutic strategies, a\\nstandardized system for classification of MI has been expanded to\\ndiscriminate MI resulting from acute coronary thrombosis (type 1 MI)\\nfrom MI occurring secondary to other imbalances of myocardial\\noxygen supply and demand (type 2 MI; see Chap. 274).

Primary\\nheadache often results in considerable disability and a decrease in\\nthe patient’s quality of life. Mild secondary headache, such as that\\nseen in association with upper respiratory tract infections, is common\\nbut rarely worrisome.

In such situations, pain perception is a normal physiologic\\nresponse mediated by a healthy nervous system. Pain can also\\nresult when pain-producing pathways of the peripheral or central\\nnervous system (CNS) are damaged or activated inappropriately.\\nHeadache may originate from either or both mechanisms. Relatively\\nfew cranial structures are pain producing; these include the scalp,\\nmeningeal arteries, dural sinuses, falx cerebri, and proximal\\nsegments of the large pial arteries. The ventricular ependyma,\\nchoroid plexus, pial veins, and much of the brain parenchyma are\\nnot pain producing.\\nThe key structures involved in primary headache are the\\nfollowing:\\n• The large intracranial vessels and dura mater, and the peripheral\\nterminals of the trigeminal nerve that innervate these structures\\n• The caudal portion of the trigeminal nucleus, which extends into the\\ndorsal horns of the upper cervical spinal cord and receives input\\nfrom the first and second cervical nerve roots (the trigeminocervical\\ncomplex)\\n• Rostral pain-processing regions, such as the ventroposteromedial\\nthalamus and the cortex\\n• The pain-modulatory systems in the brain that modulate input from\\nthe trigeminal nociceptors at all levels of the pain-processing'),\n",

These autonomic\\nsymptoms reflect activation of cranial parasympathetic pathways,\\nand functional imaging studies indicate that vascular changes in\\nmigraine and cluster headache, when present, are similarly driven by\\nthese cranial autonomic systems. Thus, they are secondary, and not\\ncausative, events in the headache cascade. Moreover, they can\\noften be mistaken for symptoms or signs of cranial sinus\\ninflammation, which is then overdiagnosed and inappropriately\\nmanaged. Migraine and other primary headache types are not\\n“vascular headaches”; these disorders do not reliably manifest\\nvascular changes, and treatment outcomes cannot be predicted by\\nvascular effects. Migraine is a brain disorder and is best understood\\nand managed as such.\\n■ CLINICAL EVALUATION OF ACUTE, NEW-ONSET HEADACHE\\nThe patient who presents with a new, severe headache has a\\ndifferential diagnosis that is quite different from the patient with\\nrecurrent headaches over many years. In new-onset and severe\\nheadache, the probability of finding a potentially serious cause is\\nconsiderably greater than in recurrent headache.

One approach is to reduce the medication\\ndose by 10% every 1–2 weeks. Immediate cessation of analgesic\\nuse is possible for some patients, provided there is no\\ncontraindication. Both approaches are facilitated by use of a\\nmedication diary maintained during the month or two before\\ncessation; this helps to identify the scope of the problem. A small\\ndose of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as\\nnaproxen, 500 mg bid, if tolerated, will help relieve residual pain as\\nanalgesic use is reduced.

Another widely used approach is to\\ncommence the preventive at the same time the analgesic\\nreduction is started. It must be emphasized that preventives may\\nnot work in the presence of analgesic overuse, particularly with\\nopioids. The most common cause of unresponsiveness to\\ntreatment is the use of a preventive when analgesics continue to\\nbe used regularly.

These numbers\\nincreased substantially from 1990 estimates, and with the aging of\\nthe population worldwide, the numbers of individuals suffering from\\nLBP are expected to increase further in the future. Although rankings\\nfor LBP generally were higher in developed regions, a high burden\\nexists in every part of the world. An area of uncertainty is the degree\\nto which regional differences exist in terms of the specific etiologies\\nof LBP and how these are managed. For example, the most\\ncommon cause of arachnoiditis in developing countries is a prior\\nspinal infection, but in developed countries the most frequent cause\\nis multiple lumbar spine surgeries.\\nTREATMENT\\nBack Pain\\nManagement is considered separately for acute and chronic low\\nback pain syndromes without radiculopathy, and for back pain with\\nradiculopathy.\\nACUTE LOW BACK PAIN WITHOUT RADICULOPATHY\\nThis is defined as pain of <12 weeks duration. Full recovery can be\\nexpected in >85% of adults with ALBP without leg pain. Most have\\npurely “mechanical” symptoms (i.e., pain that is aggravated by\\nmotion and relieved by rest).\\nThe initial assessment is focused on excluding serious causes of\\nspine pathology that require urgent intervention, including infection,\\ncancer, or trauma. Risk factors for a serious cause of ALBP are\\nshown in Table 17-1. Laboratory and imaging studies are\\nunnecessary if risk factors are absent.

Some cytokines also cause fever; formerly\\nreferred to as endogenous pyrogens, they are now called pyrogenic\\ncytokines. The pyrogenic cytokines include IL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis\\nfactor (TNF), and ciliary neurotropic factor, a member of the IL-6\\nfamily. Fever is a prominent side effect of interferon α therapy.

However, fever can be\\na manifestation of disease in the absence of microbial infection.

However, morphology may vary\\nas rashes evolve, and the presentation of diseases with rashes is\\nsubject to many variations (Chap. 58). For instance, the classic\\npetechial rash of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (Chap. 187) may\\ninitially consist of blanchable erythematous macules distributed\\nperipherally; at times, however, the rash associated with this disease\\nmay not be predominantly acral, or no rash may develop at all.\\nDiseases with fever and rash may be classified by type of\\neruption: centrally distributed maculopapular, peripheral, confluent'),\n",

Forchheimer spots (palatal\\npetechiae) may develop but are nonspecific because they also\\ndevelop in infectious mononucleosis (Chap. 194), scarlet fever\\n(Chap. 148), and Zika virus infection (Chap. 209) (Fig. A1-51D).\\nPostauricular and suboccipital adenopathy and arthritis are common\\namong adults with rubella. Exposure of pregnant women to ill\\nindividuals should be avoided, as rubella causes severe congenital\\nabnormalities. Numerous strains of enteroviruses (Chap. 204),\\nprimarily echoviruses and coxsackieviruses, cause nonspecific\\nsyndromes of fever and eruptions that may mimic rubella or\\nmeasles. Patients with infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-\\nBarr virus (Chap. 194) or with primary HIV infection (Fig. A1-6; see\\nalso Chapter 202) may exhibit pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and a\\nnonspecific maculopapular exanthem.\\nThe rash of erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), which is caused\\nby human parvovirus B19, primarily affects children 3–12 years old;\\nit develops after fever has resolved as a bright blanchable erythema\\non the cheeks (“slapped cheeks”) (Fig. A1-1A) with perioral pallor\\n(Chap. 197).

Mulders-\\nManders, Jos W. M. van der Meer\\n■ DEFINITION\\nClinicians commonly refer to any febrile illness without an initially\\nobvious etiology as fever of unknown origin (FUO). Most febrile\\nillnesses either resolve before a diagnosis can be made or develop\\ndistinguishing characteristics that lead to a diagnosis. The term FUO\\nshould be reserved for prolonged febrile illnesses without an\\nestablished etiology despite intensive evaluation and diagnostic\\ntesting. This chapter focuses on FUO in the adult patient.\\nFUO was originally defined by Petersdorf and Beeson in 1961 as\\nan illness of >3 weeks’ duration with fever of ≥38.3°C (≥101°F) on\\ntwo occasions and an uncertain diagnosis despite 1 week of\\ninpatient evaluation. Nowadays, most patients with FUO are\\nhospitalized only if their clinical condition requires it, and not for\\ndiagnostic purposes alone; thus the in-hospital evaluation\\nrequirement has been eliminated from the definition. The definition of\\nFUO has been further modified by the exclusion of\\nimmunocompromised patients, whose workup requires an entirely\\ndifferent diagnostic and therapeutic approach. For optimal\\ncomparison of patients with FUO in different geographic areas, it has\\nbeen proposed that the quantitative criterion (diagnosis uncertain\\nafter 1 week of evaluation) be changed to a qualitative criterion that\\nrequires the performance of a specific list of investigations.\\nAccordingly, FUO is now defined as follows:\\n1. Fever ≥38.3°C (≥101°F) on at least two occasions\\n2. Illness duration of ≥3 weeks\\n3. No known immunocompromised state\\n4. Diagnosis that remains uncertain after a thorough history-taking,\\nphysical examination, and the following obligatory investigations:\\ndetermination of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-'),\n",

It has been shown that the causes and workup for IUO\\nare the same as for FUO. Therefore, for convenience, the term FUO\\nwill refer to both FUO and IUO within the remainder of this chapter.\\n■ ETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\\nTable 20-1 summarizes the findings of large studies on FUO\\nconducted over the past 20 years.\\nTABLE 20-1 Etiology of FUO: Pooled Results of Large Studies\\nPublished in the Past 20 Years (1999–2019)'),\n",

The proportion of cases caused by\\nintraabdominal abscesses and tumors, for example, has decreased\\nbecause of earlier detection by CT and ultrasound. In addition,\\ninfective endocarditis is a less frequent cause because blood culture\\nand echocardiographic techniques have improved. Conversely,\\nsome diagnoses such as acute HIV infection were unknown six\\ndecades ago.\\nRoughly comparable to 60 years ago, in non-Western cohorts\\ninfections remain the most common cause of FUO. Up to half of all\\ninfections in patients with FUO outside Western nations are caused\\nby Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is a less common cause in\\nWestern Europe and probably also in the United States. Recent data\\nfrom the latter, however, have not been reported. In Western cohorts,\\nnoninfectious inflammatory diseases (NIIDs), including autoimmune,\\nautoinflammatory, and granulomatous diseases, as well as\\nvasculitides, form the most common cause of FUO. More than one-\\nthird of Western patients with FUO have a diagnosis that falls within\\nthe category of NIIDs. The number of FUO patients diagnosed with\\nNIIDs probably will not decrease in the near future, as fever may\\nprecede more typical manifestations or laboratory evidence of these\\ndiseases by months. Moreover, many NIIDs can be diagnosed only\\nafter prolonged observation and exclusion of other diseases.\\nIn Western cohorts, FUO remains unexplained in more than one-\\nthird of patients. This is much higher than 60 years ago. This\\ndifference can be explained by the fact that in patients with fever a\\ndiagnosis is often established before 3 weeks have elapsed because\\nthese patients tend to seek medical advice earlier, and because\\nbetter diagnostic techniques, such as CT, MRI, and positron\\nemission tomography (PET)/CT, are now available. Therefore, only\\nthe cases that are most difficult to diagnose continue to meet the\\ncriteria for FUO. Furthermore, most patients who have FUO without\\na diagnosis currently do well.

In patients with recurrent fever (defined as repeated episodes of\\nfever interspersed with fever-free intervals of at least 2 weeks and\\napparent remission of the underlying disease), the chance of\\nattaining an etiologic diagnosis is <50%.\\n■ DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nThe differential diagnosis for FUO is extensive. It is important to\\nremember that FUO is far more often caused by an atypical\\npresentation of a rather common disease than by a very rare\\ndisease. Table 20-2 presents an overview of possible causes of\\nFUO. Atypical presentations of endocarditis, diverticulitis, vertebral\\nosteomyelitis, and extrapulmonary tuberculosis are the more\\ncommon infectious disease diagnoses. Q fever and Whipple’s\\ndisease (Tropheryma whipplei infection) are quite rare but should\\nalways be kept in mind as a cause of FUO since the presenting\\nsymptoms can be nonspecific. Serologic testing for Q fever, which\\nresults from exposure to animals or animal products, should be\\nperformed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) when the patient\\nlives in a rural area or has a history of heart valve disease, an aortic\\naneurysm, or a vascular prosthesis. In patients with unexplained\\nsymptoms localized to the central nervous system, gastrointestinal\\ntract, or joints, polymerase chain reaction testing for Tropheryma\\nwhipplei should be performed. Travel to or (former) residence in\\ntropical countries or the American Southwest should lead to\\nconsideration of infectious diseases such as malaria, leishmaniasis,\\nhistoplasmosis, or coccidioidomycosis. Fever with signs of\\nendocarditis and negative blood culture results poses a special\\nproblem. Culture-negative endocarditis (Chap. 128) may be due to\\ndifficult-to-culture bacteria such as nutritionally variant bacteria,\\nHACEK organisms (including Haemophilus parainfluenzae, H.\\nparaphrophilus, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, A.\\naphrophilus, A. paraphrophilus, Cardiobacterium hominis, C.\\nvalvarum, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae; discussed\\nbelow), Coxiella burnetii, T. whipplei, and Bartonella species.\\nMarantic endocarditis is a sterile thrombotic disease that occurs as a\\nparaneoplastic phenomenon, especially with adenocarcinomas.'),\n",

Daroff\\nDizziness is an imprecise symptom used to describe a variety of\\ncommon sensations that include vertigo, light-headedness,\\nfaintness, and imbalance. Vertigo refers to a sense of spinning or\\nother motion that may be physiological, occurring during or after a\\nsustained head rotation, or pathological, due to vestibular\\ndysfunction. The term light-headedness is classically applied to\\npresyncopal sensations resulting from brain hypoperfusion but as\\nused by patients has little specificity, as it may also refer to other\\nsymptoms such as disequilibrium and imbalance. A challenge to\\ndiagnosis is that patients often have difficulty distinguishing among\\nthese various symptoms, and the words they choose do not reliably\\nindicate the underlying etiology.\\nThere are many causes of dizziness. Vestibular dizziness (vertigo\\nor imbalance) may be due to peripheral disorders that affect the\\nlabyrinths or vestibular nerves, or it may result from disruption of\\ncentral vestibular pathways. It may be paroxysmal or due to a fixed\\nunilateral or bilateral vestibular deficit. Acute unilateral lesions cause\\nvertigo due to a sudden imbalance in vestibular inputs from the two\\nlabyrinths. Bilateral lesions cause imbalance and instability of vision\\nwhen the head moves (oscillopsia) due to loss of normal vestibular\\nreflexes.\\nPresyncopal dizziness occurs when cardiac dysrhythmia,\\northostatic hypotension, medication effects, or another cause leads\\nto brain hypoperfusion. Such presyncopal sensations vary in\\nduration; they may increase in severity until loss of consciousness\\noccurs, or they may resolve before loss of consciousness if the\\ncerebral ischemia is corrected. Faintness and syncope, which are\\ndiscussed in detail in Chap. 21, should always be considered when\\none is evaluating patients with brief episodes of dizziness or\\ndizziness that occurs with upright posture.

(2) Is it vestibular? (3) If vestibular, is it\\nperipheral or central? A careful history and examination often\\nprovide sufficient information to answer these questions and\\ndetermine whether additional studies or referral to a specialist is\\nnecessary.\\nAPPROACH TO THE PATIENT\\nDizziness\\nHISTORY\\nWhen a patient presents with dizziness, the first step is to\\ndelineate more precisely the nature of the symptom. In the case of\\nvestibular disorders, the physical symptoms depend on whether\\nthe lesion is unilateral or bilateral, and whether it is acute or\\nchronic. Vertigo, an illusion of self or environmental motion, implies\\nan acute asymmetry of vestibular inputs from the two labyrinths or\\nin their central pathways. Symmetric bilateral vestibular\\nhypofunction causes imbalance but no vertigo. Because of the\\nambiguity in patients’ descriptions of their symptoms, diagnosis\\nbased simply on symptom characteristics is typically unreliable.\\nThus the history should focus closely on other features, including\\nwhether this is the first attack, the duration of this and any prior\\nepisodes, provoking factors, and accompanying symptoms.\\nDizziness can be divided into episodes that last for seconds,\\nminutes, hours, or days. Common causes of brief dizziness\\n(seconds) include benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)\\nand orthostatic hypotension, both of which typically are provoked\\nby changes in head and/or body position relative to gravity.\\nAttacks of vestibular migraine and Ménière’s disease often last\\nhours. When episodes are of intermediate duration (minutes),'),\n",

Because the auditory pathways quickly become bilateral\\nupon entering the brainstem, central lesions are unlikely to cause\\nunilateral hearing loss unless the lesion lies near the root entry\\nzone of the auditory nerve. Symptoms such as double vision,\\nnumbness, and limb ataxia suggest a brainstem or cerebellar\\nlesion.\\nEXAMINATION\\nBecause dizziness and imbalance can be a manifestation of a\\nvariety of neurologic disorders, the neurologic examination is\\nimportant in the evaluation of these patients. Focus should be\\ngiven to assessment of eye movements, vestibular function, and\\nhearing. The range of eye movements and whether they are equal\\nin each eye should be observed. Peripheral eye movement\\ndisorders (e.g., cranial neuropathies, eye muscle weakness) are\\nusually disconjugate (different in the two eyes). One should check\\npursuit (the ability to follow a smoothly moving target) and\\nsaccades (the ability to look back and forth accurately between\\ntwo targets). Poor pursuit or inaccurate (dysmetric) saccades\\nusually indicate central pathology, often involving the cerebellum.\\nAlignment of the two eyes can be checked with a cover test: while\\nthe patient is looking at a target, alternately cover the eyes and\\nobserve for corrective saccades. A vertical misalignment may\\nindicate a brainstem or cerebellar lesion. Finally, one should look\\nfor spontaneous nystagmus, an involuntary back-and-forth\\nmovement of the eyes. Nystagmus is most often of the jerk type, in\\nwhich a slow drift (slow phase) in one direction alternates with a\\nrapid saccadic movement (quick phase or fast phase) in the\\nopposite direction that resets the position of the eyes in the orbits.\\nExcept in the case of acute vestibulopathy (e.g., vestibular\\nneuritis), if primary position nystagmus is easily seen in the light, it\\nis probably due to a central cause.

Use of Frenzel eyeglasses\\n(self-illuminated goggles with convex lenses that blur the patient’s\\nvision but allow the examiner to see the eyes greatly magnified) or\\ninfrared video goggles can aid in the detection of peripheral\\nvestibular nystagmus, because they reduce the patient’s ability to\\nuse visual fixation to suppress nystagmus.

While the patient fixates on a target, the head is rotated\\nquickly to the left or right. If the VOR is deficient, the rotation is\\nfollowed by a catch-up saccade in the opposite direction (e.g., a\\nleftward saccade after a rightward rotation).

These symptoms are due to a sudden asymmetry of\\ninputs from the two labyrinths or in their central connections,\\nsimulating a continuous rotation of the head. Unlike BPPV,\\ncontinuous vertigo persists even when the head remains still.\\nWhen a patient presents with an acute vestibular syndrome, the\\nmost important question is whether the lesion is central (e.g., a\\ncerebellar or brainstem infarct or hemorrhage), which may be life-\\nthreatening, or peripheral, affecting the vestibular nerve or labyrinth\\n(vestibular neuritis). Attention should be given to any symptoms or\\nsigns that point to central dysfunction (diplopia, weakness or\\nnumbness, dysarthria). The pattern of spontaneous nystagmus, if\\npresent, may be helpful (Table 22-1). If the head impulse test is\\nnormal, an acute peripheral vestibular lesion is unlikely. A central\\nlesion cannot always be excluded with certainty based on symptoms\\nand examination alone; thus older patients with vascular risk factors\\nwho present with an acute vestibular syndrome should be evaluated\\nfor the possibility of stroke even when there are no specific findings\\nthat indicate a central lesion.\\nMost patients with vestibular neuritis recover spontaneously,\\nalthough chronic dizziness, motion sensitivity, and disequilibrium\\nmay persist.

Patients should be\\nencouraged to resume a normal level of activity as soon as possible,\\nand directed vestibular rehabilitation therapy may accelerate\\nimprovement.\\n■ BENIGN PAROXYSMAL POSITIONAL VERTIGO\\nBPPV is a common cause of recurrent vertigo. Episodes are brief\\n(<1 min and typically 15–20 s) and are always provoked by changes\\nin head position relative to gravity, such as lying down, rising from a\\nsupine position, and extending the head to look upward. Rolling over\\nin bed is a common trigger that may help to distinguish BPPV from\\northostatic hypotension. The attacks are caused by free-floating\\notoconia (calcium carbonate crystals) that have been dislodged from\\nthe utricular macula and have moved into one of the semicircular\\ncanals, usually the posterior canal. When head position changes,\\ngravity causes the otoconia to move within the canal, producing\\nvertigo and nystagmus. With posterior canal BPPV, the nystagmus\\nbeats upward and torsionally (the upper poles of the eyes beat\\ntoward the affected lower ear). Less commonly, the otoconia enter\\nthe horizontal canal, resulting in a horizontal nystagmus when the\\npatient is lying with either ear down. Superior (also called anterior)\\ncanal involvement is rare. BPPV is treated with repositioning\\nmaneuvers that use gravity to remove the otoconia from the\\nsemicircular canal. For posterior canal BPPV, the Epley maneuver\\n(Fig. 22-1) is the most commonly used procedure. For more\\nrefractory cases of BPPV, patients can be taught a variant of this\\nmaneuver that they can perform alone at home.

Vertigo sometimes precedes a typical migraine\\nheadache but more often occurs without headache or with only a\\nmild headache. Some patients who have had frequent migraine\\nheadaches in the past present later in life with vestibular migraine as\\nthe predominant problem. In vestibular migraine, the duration of\\nvertigo may be from minutes to hours, and some migraineurs also\\nexperience more prolonged periods of disequilibrium (lasting days to\\nweeks). Motion sensitivity and sensitivity to visual motion (e.g.,\\nmovies) are common. Even in the absence of headache, other\\nmigraine features may be present, such as photophobia,'),\n",

Antiemetics may be helpful to relieve symptoms at the\\ntime of an attack.\\n■ MÉNIÈRE’S DISEASE\\nAttacks of Ménière’s disease consist of vertigo and hearing loss, as\\nwell as pain, pressure, and/or fullness in the affected ear. Low-\\nfrequency hearing loss and aural symptoms are key features that\\ndistinguish Ménière’s disease from other peripheral vestibulopathies\\nand from vestibular migraine. Audiometry at the time of an attack\\nshows a characteristic asymmetric low-frequency hearing loss;\\nhearing commonly improves between attacks, although permanent\\nhearing loss may eventually occur. Ménière’s disease is associated\\nwith excess endolymph fluid in the inner ear; hence the term\\nendolymphatic hydrops. The exact pathophysiological mechanism,\\nhowever, remains unclear. Patients suspected of having Ménière’s\\ndisease should be referred to an otolaryngologist for further\\nevaluation. Diuretics and sodium restriction are typically the initial\\ntreatments. If attacks persist, injections of glucocorticoids or\\ngentamicin into the middle ear may be considered. Nonablative\\nsurgical options include decompression and shunting of the\\nendolymphatic sac. Full ablative procedures (vestibular nerve\\nsection, labyrinthectomy) are seldom required.\\n■ VESTIBULAR SCHWANNOMA\\nVestibular schwannomas (sometimes termed acoustic neuromas)\\nand other tumors at the cerebellopontine angle cause slowly\\nprogressive unilateral sensorineural hearing loss and vestibular\\nhypofunction.

Douglas\\nFatigue is one of the most common symptoms in clinical medicine. It\\nis a prominent manifestation of a number of systemic, neurologic,\\nand psychiatric syndromes, although a precise cause will not be\\nidentified in a substantial minority of patients. Fatigue refers to the\\nsubjective experience of physical and mental weariness,\\nsluggishness, low energy, and exhaustion. In the context of clinical\\nmedicine, fatigue is most practically defined as difficulty initiating or\\nmaintaining voluntary mental or physical activity. Nearly everyone\\nwho has ever been ill with a self-limited infection has experienced\\nthis near-universal symptom, and fatigue is usually brought to\\nmedical attention only when it is either of unclear cause, fails to\\nremit, or the severity is out of proportion with what would be\\nexpected for the associated trigger.\\nFatigue should be distinguished from muscle weakness, a\\nreduction of neuromuscular power (Chap. 24); most patients\\ncomplaining of fatigue are not truly weak when direct muscle power\\nis tested. Fatigue is also distinct from somnolence, which refers to\\nsleepiness in the context of disturbed sleep-wake physiology (Chap.\\n31), and from dyspnea on exertion, although patients may use the\\nword fatigue to describe any of these symptoms. The task facing\\nclinicians when a patient presents with fatigue is to identify the\\nunderlying cause and develop a therapeutic alliance, the goal of\\nwhich is to spare patients expensive and fruitless diagnostic workups\\nand steer them toward effective therapy.\\n■ EPIDEMIOLOGY AND GLOBAL CONSIDERATIONS\\nVariability in the definitions of fatigue and the survey instruments\\nused in different studies makes it difficult to arrive at precise figures\\nabout the global burden of fatigue. The point prevalence of fatigue\\nwas 6.7% and the lifetime prevalence was 25% in a large National\\nInstitute of Mental Health survey of the U.S. general population. In'),\n",

In a community survey of women in India, 12% reported\\nchronic fatigue. By contrast, the prevalence of chronic fatigue\\nsyndrome (Chap. 450), as defined by the U.S. Centers for Disease\\nControl and Prevention, is low.\\n■ DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nPsychiatric Disease Fatigue is a common somatic manifestation of\\nmany major psychiatric syndromes, including depression, anxiety,\\nand somatoform disorders (Chap. 452). Psychiatric symptoms are\\nreported in more than three-quarters of patients with unexplained\\nchronic fatigue. Even in patients with systemic or neurologic\\ndisorders in which fatigue is independently recognized as a\\nsymptom, comorbid psychiatric disease may still be an important\\ncontributor.\\nFatigue Patients complaining of fatigue often say they feel weak, but\\nupon careful examination, objective muscle weakness is rarely\\ndiscernible. If found, muscle weakness must then be localized to the\\ncentral nervous system, peripheral nervous system, neuromuscular\\njunction, or muscle, and appropriate follow-up studies obtained\\n(Chap. 24). Fatigability of muscle power is a cardinal manifestation\\nof some neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis and is\\ndistinguished from fatigue by finding clinically evident diminution of\\nthe amount of force that a muscle generates upon repeated\\ncontraction (Chap. 448). Fatigue is one of the most common and\\nbothersome symptoms reported in multiple sclerosis (MS) (Chap.\\n444), affecting nearly 90% of patients; fatigue in MS can persist\\nbetween MS attacks and does not necessarily correlate with\\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disease activity. Fatigue is also\\nincreasingly identified as a troublesome feature of many\\nneurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease (Chap.\\n435), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Chap. 437), and central nervous\\nsystem dysautonomias (Chap. 440).

Whether the cumulative sleep\\ndeprivation that is common in modern society contributes to clinically\\napparent fatigue is not known (Chap. 31).\\nEndocrine Disorders Fatigue, sometimes in association with true\\nmuscle weakness, can be a heralding symptom of hypothyroidism\\n(Chap. 383), particularly in the context of hair loss, dry skin, cold\\nintolerance, constipation, and weight gain. Fatigue associated with\\nheat intolerance, sweating, and palpitations is typical of\\nhyperthyroidism (Chap. 384). Adrenal insufficiency (Chap. 386) can\\nalso manifest with unexplained fatigue as a primary or prominent\\nsymptom, often with anorexia, weight loss, nausea, myalgias, and\\narthralgias; hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hyperpigmentation\\nmay be present at time of diagnosis. Mild hypercalcemia can cause\\nfatigue, which may be relatively vague, whereas severe\\nhypercalcemia can lead to lethargy, stupor, and coma (Chap. 410).\\nBoth hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia can cause lethargy, often in\\nassociation with confusion; diabetes mellitus, and in particular type 1\\ndiabetes, is also associated with fatigue independent of glucose\\nlevels (Chap. 403).

The descending ventromedial bulbospinal pathways originate in the\\ntectum of the midbrain (tectospinal pathway), the vestibular nuclei (vestibulospinal\\npathway), and the reticular formation (reticulospinal pathway). These pathways\\ninfluence axial and proximal muscles and are involved in the maintenance of\\nposture and integrated movements of the limbs and trunk. The descending\\nventrolateral bulbospinal pathways, which originate predominantly in the red\\nnucleus (rubrospinal pathway), facilitate distal limb muscles. The bulbospinal\\nsystem sometimes is referred to as the extrapyramidal upper motor neuron\\nsystem. In all figures, nerve cell bodies and axon terminals are shown,\\nrespectively, as closed circles and forks.\\nLower Motor Neuron Weakness This pattern results from disorders\\nof lower motor neurons in the brainstem motor nuclei and the\\nanterior horn of the spinal cord or from dysfunction of the axons of\\nthese neurons as they pass to skeletal muscle (Fig. 24-2).\\nWeakness is due to a decrease in the number of muscle fibers that\\ncan be activated through a loss of α motor neurons or disruption of\\ntheir connections to muscle. Loss of γ motor neurons does not cause\\nweakness but decreases tension on the muscle spindles, which\\ndecreases muscle tone and attenuates the stretch reflexes.

The presence of other neurologic\\ndeficits helps localize the lesion. Thus language disorders, for\\nexample, point to a cortical lesion. Homonymous visual field defects\\nreflect either a cortical or a subcortical hemispheric lesion.

Some brainstem lesions\\nproduce “crossed paralyses,” consisting of ipsilateral cranial nerve\\nsigns and contralateral hemiparesis (Chap. 426). The absence of\\ncranial nerve signs or facial weakness suggests that a hemiparesis\\nis due to a lesion in the high cervical spinal cord, especially if\\nassociated with Brown-Séquard syndrome, consisting of loss of joint\\nposition and vibration sense on the side of the weakness, and loss of\\npain and temperature sense on the opposite side (Chap. 442).\\nAcute or episodic hemiparesis usually results from focal\\nstructural lesions, particularly vascular etiologies, rapidly expanding\\nlesions, or an inflammatory process. Subacute hemiparesis that\\nevolves over days or weeks may relate to subdural hematoma,\\ninfectious or inflammatory disorders (e.g., cerebral abscess, fungal\\ngranuloma or meningitis, parasitic infection, multiple sclerosis,\\nsarcoidosis), or primary or metastatic neoplasms.

Pain is considered separately in Chap. 13.\\n■ POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS\\nAbnormal sensory symptoms can be divided into two categories:\\npositive and negative. The prototypical positive symptom is tingling\\n(pins and needles); other positive sensory phenomena include itch\\nand altered sensations that are described as pricking, bandlike,\\nlightning-like shooting feelings (lancinations), aching, knifelike,\\ntwisting, drawing, pulling, tightening, burning, searing, electrical, or\\nraw feelings.

Hyperesthesia means pain or increased sensitivity in\\nresponse to touch. Similarly, allodynia describes the situation in\\nwhich a nonpainful stimulus, once perceived, is experienced as\\npainful, even excruciating.

Distal dysesthesias can also be an early event in an\\nevolving polyneuropathy or may herald a myelopathy, such as from\\nvitamin B12 deficiency.

These functions are widely\\ndistributed in the central nervous system. The biomechanics of\\nbipedal walking are complex, and the performance is easily\\ncompromised by a neurologic deficit at any level. Command and\\ncontrol centers in the brainstem, cerebellum, and forebrain modify\\nthe action of spinal pattern generators to promote stepping. While a\\nform of “fictive locomotion” can be elicited from quadrupedal animals\\nafter spinal transection, this capacity is limited in primates. Step\\ngeneration in primates is dependent on locomotor centers in the\\npontine tegmentum, midbrain, and subthalamic region. Locomotor\\nsynergies are executed through the reticular formation and\\ndescending pathways in the ventromedial spinal cord. Cerebral\\ncontrol provides a goal and purpose for walking and is involved in\\navoidance of obstacles and adaptation of locomotor programs to\\ncontext and terrain.\\nPostural control requires the maintenance of the center of mass\\nover the base of support through the gait cycle.

Forward motion of the center of\\nmass provides propulsive force for stepping, but failure to maintain\\nthe center of mass within stability limits results in falls. The anatomic\\nsubstrate for dynamic balance has not been well defined, but the\\nvestibular nucleus and midline cerebellum contribute to balance\\ncontrol in animals. Patients with damage to these structures have\\nimpaired balance while standing and walking.\\nStanding balance depends on good-quality sensory information\\nabout the position of the body center with respect to the\\nenvironment, support surface, and gravitational forces. Sensory\\ninformation for postural control is primarily generated by the visual\\nsystem, the vestibular system, and proprioceptive receptors in the\\nmuscle spindles and joints. A healthy redundancy of sensory afferent\\ninformation is generally available, but loss of two of the three\\npathways is sufficient to compromise standing balance. Balance\\ndisorders in older individuals sometimes result from multiple insults\\nin the peripheral sensory systems (e.g., visual loss, vestibular deficit,\\nperipheral neuropathy) that critically degrade the quality of afferent\\ninformation needed for balance stability.\\nOlder patients with cognitive impairment appear to be particularly\\nprone to falls and injury. There is a growing body of literature on the\\nuse of attentional resources to manage gait and balance. Walking is\\ngenerally considered to be unconscious and automatic, but the\\nability to walk while attending to a cognitive task (dual-task walking)\\nmay be compromised in the elderly. Older patients with deficits in\\nexecutive function may have particular difficulty in managing the\\nattentional resources needed for dynamic balance when distracted.\\nDISORDERS OF GAIT\\nDisorders of gait may be attributed to neurologic and nonneurologic\\ncauses, although significant overlap often exists.

Delirium, a term used to describe an\\nacute confusional state, remains a major cause of morbidity and\\nmortality, costing billions of dollars yearly in health care costs in the\\nUnited States alone. Despite increased efforts targeting awareness\\nof this condition, delirium often goes unrecognized in the face of\\nevidence that it is usually the cognitive manifestation of serious\\nunderlying medical or neurologic illness.\\n■ CLINICAL FEATURES OF DELIRIUM\\nA multitude of terms are used to describe patients with delirium,\\nincluding encephalopathy, acute brain failure, acute confusional\\nstate, and postoperative or intensive care unit (ICU) psychosis.\\nDelirium has many clinical manifestations, but it is defined as a\\nrelatively acute decline in cognition that fluctuates over hours or\\ndays. The hallmark of delirium is a deficit of attention, although all\\ncognitive domains—including memory, executive function,\\nvisuospatial tasks, and language—are variably involved. Associated\\nsymptoms that may be present in some cases include altered sleep-\\nwake cycles, perceptual disturbances such as hallucinations or\\ndelusions, affect changes, and autonomic findings that include heart\\nrate and blood pressure instability.\\nDelirium is a clinical diagnosis that is made only at the bedside.\\nTwo subtypes have been described—hyperactive and hypoactive—\\nbased on differential psychomotor features. The cognitive syndrome\\nassociated with severe alcohol withdrawal (i.e., “delirium tremens”)\\nremains the classic example of the hyperactive subtype, featuring\\nprominent hallucinations, agitation, and hyperarousal, often'),\n",

In striking\\ncontrast is the hypoactive subtype, exemplified by benzodiazepine\\nintoxication, in which patients are withdrawn and quiet, with\\nprominent apathy and psychomotor slowing.\\nThis dichotomy between subtypes of delirium is a useful\\nconstruct, but patients often fall somewhere along a spectrum\\nbetween the hyperactive and hypoactive extremes, sometimes\\nfluctuating from one to the other. Therefore, clinicians must\\nrecognize this broad range of presentations of delirium to identify all\\npatients with this potentially reversible cognitive disturbance.\\nHyperactive patients are often easily recognized by their\\ncharacteristic severe agitation, tremor, hallucinations, and autonomic\\ninstability. Patients who are quietly hypoactive are more often\\noverlooked on the medical wards and in the ICU.\\nThe reversibility of delirium is emphasized because many\\netiologies, such as infection and medication effects, can be treated\\neasily. The long-term cognitive consequences of delirium remain an\\narea of active research. Some episodes of delirium continue for\\nweeks, months, or even years. The persistence of delirium in some\\npatients and its high recurrence rate may be due to inadequate initial\\ntreatment of the underlying etiology. In other instances, delirium\\nappears to cause permanent neuronal damage and long-term\\ncognitive decline. Therefore, prevention strategies are important to\\nimplement. Even if an episode of delirium completely resolves, there\\nmay be lingering effects of the disorder; a patient’s recall of events\\nafter delirium varies widely, ranging from complete amnesia to\\nrepeated reexperiencing of the frightening period of confusion,\\nsimilar to what is seen in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder.\\n■ RISK FACTORS\\nAn effective primary prevention strategy for delirium begins with\\nidentification of high-risk patients.

Individuals who are aged >65 or\\nexhibit low scores on standardized tests of cognition develop\\ndelirium upon hospitalization at a rate approaching 50%. Whether\\nage and baseline cognitive dysfunction are truly independent risk\\nfactors is uncertain. Other predisposing factors include sensory\\ndeprivation, such as preexisting hearing and visual impairment, as\\nwell as indices for poor overall health, including baseline immobility,\\nmalnutrition, and underlying medical or neurologic illness.\\nIn-hospital risks for delirium include the use of bladder\\ncatheterization, physical restraints, sleep and sensory deprivation,\\nand the addition of three or more new medications. Avoiding such\\nrisks remains a key component of delirium prevention as well as\\ntreatment. Surgical and anesthetic risk factors for the development of\\npostoperative delirium include procedures such as those involving\\ncardiopulmonary bypass, inadequate or excessive treatment of pain\\nin the immediate postoperative period, and perhaps specific agents\\nsuch as inhalational anesthetics.\\nThe relationship between delirium and dementia (Chap. 29) is\\ncomplicated by significant overlap between the two conditions, and it\\nis not always simple to distinguish between them.

As\\nnoted earlier, patients with preexisting dementia are particularly\\nsusceptible to episodes of delirium. Alzheimer’s disease (Chap.\\n431), dementia with Lewy bodies (Chap. 434), and Parkinson’s\\ndisease dementia (Chap. 435) are all associated with cholinergic\\ndeficiency due to degeneration of acetylcholine-producing neurons in\\nthe basal forebrain. In addition, other neurotransmitters are also\\nlikely to be involved in this diffuse cerebral disorder.

The\\nprevalence of disabling memory loss increases with each decade\\nover age 50 and is usually associated with the microscopic changes\\nof AD at autopsy.

Whether\\ndementia is an inevitable consequence of normal human aging\\nremains controversial although the prevalence increases with every\\ndecade of life.\\nThe many causes of dementia are listed in Table 29-1. The\\nfrequency of each condition depends on the age group under study,\\naccess of the group to medical care, country of origin, and perhaps\\nracial or ethnic background. AD is the most common cause of\\ndementia in Western countries, accounting for more than half of all\\npatients. Vascular disease is the second most frequent cause for\\ndementia and is particularly common in elderly patients or\\npopulations with limited access to medical care, where vascular risk\\nfactors are undertreated. Often, vascular brain injury is mixed with\\nneurodegenerative disorders, particularly AD, making it difficult, even\\nfor the neuropathologist, to estimate the contribution of\\ncerebrovascular disease to the cognitive disorder in an individual\\npatient.

Factors that predict progression from MCI to an AD dementia\\ninclude a prominent memory deficit, family history of dementia,\\npresence of an apolipoprotein ε4 (Apo ε4) allele, small hippocampal\\nvolumes, an AD-like signature of cortical atrophy, low cerebrospinal\\nfluid Aβ and elevated tau, or evidence of brain amyloid and tau\\ndeposition on positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.\\nThe major degenerative dementias include AD, DLB, FTD and\\nrelated disorders, HD, and prion diseases, including CJD.

A deficit of naming (anomia) is the single most common\\nfinding in aphasic patients. When asked to name a common object,\\nthe patient may fail to come up with the appropriate word, may\\nprovide a circumlocutious description of the object (“the thing for\\nwriting”), or may come up with the wrong word (paraphasia). If the\\npatient offers an incorrect but related word (“pen” for “pencil”), the\\nnaming error is known as a semantic paraphasia; if the word\\napproximates the correct answer but is phonetically inaccurate\\n(“plentil” for “pencil”), it is known as a phonemic paraphasia. In most\\nanomias, the patient cannot retrieve the appropriate name when\\nshown an object but can point to the appropriate object when the\\nname is provided by the examiner. This is known as a one-way (or\\nretrieval-based) naming deficit. A two-way (comprehension-based or\\nsemantic) naming deficit exists if the patient can neither provide nor\\nrecognize the correct name. Spontaneous speech is described as\\n“fluent” if it maintains appropriate output volume, phrase length, and\\nmelody or as “nonfluent” if it is sparse and halting and average\\nutterance length is below four words. The examiner also should note\\nthe integrity of grammar as manifested by word order (syntax),\\ntenses, suffixes, prefixes, plurals, and possessives. Comprehension\\ncan be tested by assessing the patient’s ability to follow\\nconversation, asking yes-no questions (“Can a dog fly?” “Does it\\nsnow in summer?”), asking the patient to point to appropriate objects\\n(“Where is the source of illumination in this room?”), or asking for\\nverbal definitions of single words. Repetition is assessed by asking\\nthe patient to repeat single words, short sentences, or strings of\\nwords such as “No ifs, ands, or buts.” The testing of repetition with\\ntongue twisters such as “hippopotamus” and “Irish constabulary”\\nprovides a better assessment of dysarthria and apraxia of speech'),\n",

It is important to make sure that the number of\\nwords does not exceed the patient’s attention span. Otherwise, the\\nfailure of repetition becomes a reflection of the narrowed attention\\nspan (auditory working memory) rather than an indication of an\\naphasic deficit caused by dysfunction of a hypothetical phonological\\nloop in the language network. Reading should be assessed for\\ndeficits in reading aloud as well as comprehension. Alexia describes\\nan inability to either read aloud or comprehend written words and\\nsentences; agraphia (or dysgraphia) is used to describe an acquired\\ndeficit in spelling.\\nAphasias can arise acutely in cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs)\\nor gradually in neurodegenerative diseases.

According to one model of spatial\\ncognition, the right hemisphere directs attention within the entire\\nextrapersonal space, whereas the left hemisphere directs attention\\nmostly within the contralateral right hemispace. Consequently, left\\nhemisphere lesions do not give rise to much contralesional neglect\\nbecause the global attentional mechanisms of the right hemisphere\\ncan compensate for the loss of the contralaterally directed attentional\\nfunctions of the left hemisphere. Right hemisphere lesions, however,\\ngive rise to severe contralesional left hemispatial neglect because\\nthe unaffected left hemisphere does not contain ipsilateral attentional\\nmechanisms. This model is consistent with clinical experience, which\\nshows that contralesional neglect is more common, more severe,\\nand longer lasting after damage to the right hemisphere than after\\ndamage to the left hemisphere.

A patient with simultanagnosia “misses the forest\\nfor the trees.” For example, a patient who is shown a table lamp and\\nasked to name the object may look at its circular base and call it an\\nashtray. Some patients with simultanagnosia report that objects they\\nlook at may vanish suddenly, probably indicating an inability to\\ncompute the oculomotor return to the original point of gaze after brief\\nsaccadic displacements. Movement and distracting stimuli greatly\\nexacerbate the difficulties of visual perception. Simultanagnosia can\\noccur without the other two components of Bálint’s syndrome,\\nespecially in association with AD.\\nA modification of the letter cancellation task described above can\\nbe used for the bedside diagnosis of simultanagnosia. In this\\nmodification, some of the targets (e.g., A’s) are made to be much\\nlarger than the others (7.5–10 cm vs 2.5 cm [3–4 in. vs 1 in.] in\\nheight), and all targets are embedded among foils. Patients with\\nsimultanagnosia display a counterintuitive but characteristic\\ntendency to miss the larger targets (Fig. 30-3B ). This occurs\\nbecause the information needed for the identification of the larger\\ntargets cannot be confined to the immediate line of gaze and\\nrequires the integration of visual information across multiple fixation\\npoints.

Dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) in DSWPD patients\\noccurs later in the evening than normal, which is about 8:00–9:00\\nP.M. (i.e., about 1–2 h before habitual bedtime). Patients tend to be\\nyoung adults. The delayed circadian phase could be due to: (1) an\\nabnormally long, genetically determined intrinsic period of the\\nendogenous circadian pacemaker; (2) reduced phase-advancing\\ncapacity of the pacemaker; (3) slower buildup of homeostatic sleep\\ndrive during wakefulness; or (4) an irregular prior sleep-wake\\nschedule, characterized by frequent nights when the patient chooses\\nto remain awake while exposed to artificial light well past midnight\\n(for personal, social, school, or work reasons).

The act of seeing begins with the capture of\\nimages focused by the cornea and lens on a light-sensitive\\nmembrane in the back of the eye called the retina. The retina is\\nactually part of the brain, banished to the periphery to serve as a\\ntransducer for the conversion of patterns of light energy into\\nneuronal signals. Light is absorbed by pigment in two types of\\nphotoreceptors: rods and cones. In the human retina, there are 100\\nmillion rods and 5 million cones. The rods operate in dim (scotopic)\\nillumination. The cones function under daylight (photopic) conditions.\\nThe cone system is specialized for color perception and high spatial\\nresolution. The majority of cones are within the macula, the portion\\nof the retina that serves the central 10° of vision. In the middle of the\\nmacula, a small pit termed the fovea, packed exclusively with cones,\\nprovides the best visual acuity.\\nPhotoreceptors hyperpolarize in response to light, activating\\nbipolar, amacrine, and horizontal cells in the inner nuclear layer.\\nAfter processing of photoreceptor responses by this complex retinal\\ncircuit, the flow of sensory information ultimately converges on a final\\ncommon pathway: the ganglion cells. These cells translate the visual\\nimage impinging on the retina into a continuously varying barrage of\\naction potentials that propagates along the primary optic pathway to\\nvisual centers within the brain. There are a million ganglion cells in\\neach retina and hence a million fibers in each optic nerve.\\nGanglion cell axons sweep along the inner surface of the retina in\\nthe nerve fiber layer, exit the eye at the optic disc, and travel through\\nthe optic nerve, optic chiasm, and optic tract to reach targets in the\\nbrain.

If the retina or optic nerve is only partially\\ninjured, the direct pupillary response will be weaker than the\\nconsensual pupillary response evoked by shining a light into the\\nhealthy fellow eye. A relative afferent pupillary defect (Marcus Gunn\\npupil) is elicited with the swinging flashlight test (Fig. 32-2).

The first concern is an oculomotor nerve\\nparesis. This possibility is excluded if the eye movements are full\\nand the patient has no ptosis or diplopia.

The red and green cone pigments are encoded on\\nthe X chromosome, and the blue cone pigment on chromosome 7.\\nMutations of the blue cone pigment are exceedingly rare. Mutations\\nof the red and green pigments cause congenital X-linked color\\nblindness in 8% of males. Affected individuals are not truly color\\nblind; rather, they differ from normal subjects in the way they\\nperceive color and how they combine primary monochromatic lights'),\n",

Anomalous trichromats have three cone\\ntypes, but a mutation in one cone pigment (usually red or green)\\ncauses a shift in peak spectral sensitivity, altering the proportion of\\nprimary colors required to achieve a color match. Dichromats have\\nonly two cone types and therefore will accept a color match based\\non only two primary colors. Anomalous trichromats and dichromats\\nhave 6/6 (20/20) visual acuity, but their hue discrimination is\\nimpaired. Ishihara color plates can be used to detect red-green color\\nblindness. The test plates contain a hidden number that is visible\\nonly to subjects with color confusion from red-green color blindness.\\nBecause color blindness is almost exclusively X-linked, it is\\nworthwhile screening only male children.\\nThe Ishihara plates often are used to detect acquired defects in\\ncolor vision, although they are intended as a screening test for\\ncongenital color blindness. Acquired defects in color vision frequently\\nresult from disease of the macula or optic nerve. For example,\\npatients with a history of optic neuritis often complain of color\\ndesaturation long after their visual acuity has returned to normal.\\nColor blindness also can result from bilateral strokes involving the\\nventral portion of the occipital lobe (cerebral achromatopsia). Such\\npatients can perceive only shades of gray and also may have\\ndifficulty recognizing faces (prosopagnosia) (Chap. 30).

One can localize the site of the\\nlesion with considerable accuracy by mapping the visual field deficit\\nby finger confrontation and then correlating it with the topographic\\nanatomy of the visual pathway (Fig. 32-3). Quantitative visual field\\nmapping is performed by computer-driven perimeters that present a\\ntarget of variable intensity at fixed positions in the visual field (Fig.\\n32-3A ).

If a scotoma is confined to\\none eye, it must be due to a lesion anterior to the chiasm, involving\\neither the optic nerve or the retina. Retinal lesions produce scotomas\\nthat correspond optically to their location in the fundus. For example,\\na superior-nasal retinal detachment results in an inferior-temporal\\nfield cut.

Examples are\\nalbinism, Leber’s congenital amaurosis, and bilateral cataract. This\\nnystagmus is commonly referred to as congenital sensory\\nnystagmus. This is a poor term because even in children with\\ncongenital lesions, the nystagmus does not appear until weeks after\\nbirth. Congenital motor nystagmus, which looks similar to congenital\\nsensory nystagmus, develops in the absence of any abnormality of\\nthe sensory visual system. Visual acuity also is reduced in congenital\\nmotor nystagmus, probably by the nystagmus itself, but seldom\\nbelow a level of 20/200.\\nJERK NYSTAGMUS This is characterized by a slow drift off the target,\\nfollowed by a fast corrective saccade. By convention, the nystagmus\\nis named after the quick phase. Jerk nystagmus can be downbeat,\\nupbeat, horizontal (left or right), and torsional. The pattern of\\nnystagmus may vary with gaze position. Some patients will be\\noblivious to their nystagmus.

When the eyes are held eccentrically in the orbits, they\\nhave a natural tendency to drift back to primary position. The subject\\ncompensates by making a corrective saccade to maintain the\\ndeviated eye position. Many normal patients have mild gaze-evoked\\nnystagmus.

Bromley\\nAll environmental chemicals necessary for life enter the body by the\\nnose and mouth. The senses of smell (olfaction) and taste\\n(gustation) monitor such chemicals, determine the flavor and\\npalatability of foods and beverages, and warn of dangerous\\nenvironmental conditions, including fire, air pollution, leaking natural\\ngas, and bacteria-laden foodstuffs. These senses contribute\\nsignificantly to quality of life and, when dysfunctional, can have\\nuntoward physical and psychological consequences. A longitudinal\\nstudy of 1162 nondemented elderly persons found, even after\\ncontrolling for confounders, that those with the lowest baseline\\nolfactory test scores had a 45% mortality rate over a 4-year period,\\ncompared to an 18% mortality rate for those with the highest\\nolfactory test scores. A basic understanding of these senses in\\nhealth and disease is critical for the physician, because thousands of\\npatients present to doctors’ offices each year with complaints of\\nchemosensory dysfunction. Among the more important recent\\ndevelopments in neurology is the discovery that decreased smell\\nfunction is among the first signs of such neurodegenerative diseases\\nas Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD),\\nsignifying their “presymptomatic” phase.\\n■ ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY\\nOlfactory System Odorous chemicals enter the front of nose during\\ninhalation and active sniffing, as well as the back of the nose\\n(nasopharynx) during deglutition.
